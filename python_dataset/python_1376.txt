        Topic: While Loops: Advanced Techniques
        Question: How do you implement While Loops (Advanced Techniques) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        While Loops is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving while loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating While Loops
print('Example 1376')
