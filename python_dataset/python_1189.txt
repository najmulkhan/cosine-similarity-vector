        Topic: Encapsulation: Short Tutorial
        Question: Explain the concept of Encapsulation (Short Tutorial) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Encapsulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving encapsulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Encapsulation
print('Example 1189')
