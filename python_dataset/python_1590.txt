        Topic: Default Arguments: Comparison with alternatives (variant 1590)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Default Arguments (Comparison with alternatives)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Default Arguments is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving default arguments.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Default Arguments
print('Example 1590')
