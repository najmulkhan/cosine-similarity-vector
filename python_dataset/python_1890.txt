        Question: What are the key principles behind Code Formatting (black, flake8) (Testing Strategies)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Code Formatting (black, flake8) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving code formatting (black, flake8).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Code Formatting (black, flake8)
print('Example 1890')
