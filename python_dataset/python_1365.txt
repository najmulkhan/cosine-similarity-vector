        Topic: Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort): Beginner Guide (variant 1365)
        Question: Describe Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) (Beginner Guide) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort)
print('Example 1365')
