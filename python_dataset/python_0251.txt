        Question: What are the key principles behind Generators (Common Mistakes)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Generators is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Generators
print('Example 251')
