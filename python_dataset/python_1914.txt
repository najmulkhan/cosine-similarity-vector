        Topic: Magic Methods (__init__, __str__): Testing Strategies
        Question: Explain the concept of Magic Methods (__init__, __str__) (Testing Strategies) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Magic Methods (__init__, __str__) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving magic methods (__init__, __str__).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Magic Methods (__init__, __str__)
print('Example 1914')
