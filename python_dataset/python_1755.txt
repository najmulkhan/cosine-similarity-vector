        Topic: Greedy Algorithms: Hands-on Example
        Question: Describe Greedy Algorithms (Hands-on Example) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Greedy Algorithms is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving greedy algorithms.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
9. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Greedy Algorithms
print('Example 1755')
