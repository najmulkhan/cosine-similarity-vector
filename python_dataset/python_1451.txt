        Topic: Iterators: Implementation Walkthrough (variant 1451)
        Question: Explain the concept of Iterators (Implementation Walkthrough) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Iterators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving iterators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
