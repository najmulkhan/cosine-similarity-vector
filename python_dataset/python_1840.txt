        Topic: Reflection and inspect: Beginner Guide (variant 1840)
        Question: Describe Reflection and inspect (Beginner Guide) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Reflection and inspect is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving reflection and inspect.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
9. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
10. Document assumptions and usage examples.
11. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Reflection and inspect
print('Example 1840')
