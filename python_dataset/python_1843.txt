        Question: What are the key principles behind Flask Routing and Templates (Short Tutorial)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Flask Routing and Templates is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving flask routing and templates.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
9. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
10. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
11. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
