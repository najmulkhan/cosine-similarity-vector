        Topic: Refactoring Techniques: Security Considerations
        Question: What are the key principles behind Refactoring Techniques (Security Considerations)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Refactoring Techniques is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving refactoring techniques.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Refactoring Techniques
print('Example 953')
