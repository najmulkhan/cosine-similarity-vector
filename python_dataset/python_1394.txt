        Topic: Virtual Environments: Security Considerations
        Question: How does Virtual Environments (Security Considerations) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Virtual Environments is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving virtual environments.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Virtual Environments
print('Example 1394')
