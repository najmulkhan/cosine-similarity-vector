        Topic: Default Arguments: Step-by-Step
        Question: How do you implement Default Arguments (Step-by-Step) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Default Arguments is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving default arguments.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Default Arguments
print('Example 1665')
