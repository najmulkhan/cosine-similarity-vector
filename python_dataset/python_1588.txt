        Topic: Variables and Data Types: Testing Strategies (variant 1588)
        Question: How does Variables and Data Types (Testing Strategies) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Variables and Data Types is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving variables and data types.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        x = 5
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
