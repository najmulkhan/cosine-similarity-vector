        Topic: Classes and Objects: Testing Strategies (variant 1468)
        Question: Explain the concept of Classes and Objects (Testing Strategies) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Classes and Objects is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving classes and objects.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
