        Topic: Security Basics (Input Sanitization): Advanced Techniques
        Question: How do you implement Security Basics (Input Sanitization) (Advanced Techniques) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Security Basics (Input Sanitization) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving security basics (input sanitization).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.
9. Document assumptions and usage examples.
10. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
11. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Security Basics (Input Sanitization)
print('Example 1993')
