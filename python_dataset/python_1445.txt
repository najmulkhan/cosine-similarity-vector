        Topic: Exponential Backoff: Advanced Techniques (variant 1445)
        Question: Explain the concept of Exponential Backoff (Advanced Techniques) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Exponential Backoff is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving exponential backoff.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Exponential Backoff
print('Example 1445')
