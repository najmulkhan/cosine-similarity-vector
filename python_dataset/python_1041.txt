        Topic: Unit Testing with unittest: Security Considerations
        Question: How do you implement Unit Testing with unittest (Security Considerations) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Unit Testing with unittest is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving unit testing with unittest.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Unit Testing with unittest
print('Example 1041')
