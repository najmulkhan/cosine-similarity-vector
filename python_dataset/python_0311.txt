        Topic: Operators: Best Practices
        Question: Describe Operators (Best Practices) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Operators is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving operators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Operators
