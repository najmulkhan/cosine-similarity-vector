        Topic: Sockets Programming: Cheat Sheet
        Question: Explain the concept of Sockets Programming (Cheat Sheet) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Sockets Programming is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving sockets programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',9000))
