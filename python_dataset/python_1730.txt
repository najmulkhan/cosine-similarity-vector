        Topic: APIs and JSON: Comparison with alternatives (variant 1730)
        Question: What are the key principles behind APIs and JSON (Comparison with alternatives)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        APIs and JSON is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving apis and json.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
9. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
10. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
11. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating APIs and JSON
print('Example 1730')
