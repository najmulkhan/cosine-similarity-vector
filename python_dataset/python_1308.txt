        Topic: Rate Limiting: Interview Question
        Question: Explain the concept of Rate Limiting (Interview Question) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Rate Limiting is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving rate limiting.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Rate Limiting
print('Example 1308')
