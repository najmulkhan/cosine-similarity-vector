        Topic: Recursion Basics: In-depth Explanation (variant 1172)
        Question: How do you implement Recursion Basics (In-depth Explanation) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Recursion Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving recursion basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n<=1 else n*factorial(n-1)
