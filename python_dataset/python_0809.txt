        Topic: Encapsulation: Cheat Sheet (variant 809)
        Question: How does Encapsulation (Cheat Sheet) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Encapsulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving encapsulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Encapsulation
print('Example 809')
