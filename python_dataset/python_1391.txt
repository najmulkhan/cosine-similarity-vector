        Topic: Control Flow: Implementation Walkthrough (variant 1391)
        Question: How does Control Flow (Implementation Walkthrough) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Control Flow is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving control flow.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Control Flow
print('Example 1391')
