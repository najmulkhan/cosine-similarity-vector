        Topic: Multiprocessing Basics: Common Mistakes
        Question: What are the key principles behind Multiprocessing Basics (Common Mistakes)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Multiprocessing Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving multiprocessing basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Multiprocessing Basics
print('Example 1335')
