        Topic: Performance Profiling: Best Practices
        Question: Describe Performance Profiling (Best Practices) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Performance Profiling is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving performance profiling.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Performance Profiling
print('Example 1518')
