        Topic: Functions and Parameters (variant 1631)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Functions and Parameters? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Functions and Parameters is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving functions and parameters.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
9. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Functions and Parameters
print('Example 1631')
