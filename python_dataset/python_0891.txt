        Topic: Multiprocessing Basics: Step-by-Step
        Question: What are the key principles behind Multiprocessing Basics (Step-by-Step)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Multiprocessing Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving multiprocessing basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Multiprocessing Basics
print('Example 891')
