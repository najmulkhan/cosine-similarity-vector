        Topic: State Machines: Best Practices
        Question: Describe State Machines (Best Practices) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        State Machines is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving state machines.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating State Machines
print('Example 121')
