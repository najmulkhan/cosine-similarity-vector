        Topic: Circuit Breaker Patterns: Interview Question (variant 1700)
        Question: Describe Circuit Breaker Patterns (Interview Question) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Circuit Breaker Patterns is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving circuit breaker patterns.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
