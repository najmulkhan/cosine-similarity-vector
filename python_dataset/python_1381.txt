        Topic: Inheritance and Polymorphism: Step-by-Step (variant 1381)
        Question: Explain the concept of Inheritance and Polymorphism (Step-by-Step) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Inheritance and Polymorphism is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving inheritance and polymorphism.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Inheritance and Polymorphism
print('Example 1381')
