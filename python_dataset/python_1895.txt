        Topic: Environment Variables: Security Considerations (variant 1895)
        Question: Explain the concept of Environment Variables (Security Considerations) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Environment Variables is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving environment variables.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
9. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Environment Variables
print('Example 1895')
