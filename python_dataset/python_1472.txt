        Topic: Data Serialization (pickle, marshal): Step-by-Step
        Question: Describe Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) (Step-by-Step) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving data serialization (pickle, marshal).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Data Serialization (pickle, marshal)
print('Example 1472')
