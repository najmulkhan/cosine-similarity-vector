        Topic: Internationalization (i18n): Testing Strategies
        Question: What are the key principles behind Internationalization (i18n) (Testing Strategies)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Internationalization (i18n) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving internationalization (i18n).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Internationalization (i18n)
print('Example 1117')
