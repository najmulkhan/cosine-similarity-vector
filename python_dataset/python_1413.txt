        Topic: Rate Limiting: Common Mistakes
        Question: What are the key principles behind Rate Limiting (Common Mistakes)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Rate Limiting is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving rate limiting.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Rate Limiting
print('Example 1413')
