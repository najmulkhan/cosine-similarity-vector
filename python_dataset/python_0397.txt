        Topic: Sockets Programming: Best Practices
        Question: What are the key principles behind Sockets Programming (Best Practices)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Sockets Programming is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving sockets programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',9000))
