        Topic: Garbage Collection: Security Considerations
        Question: Describe Garbage Collection (Security Considerations) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Garbage Collection is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving garbage collection.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Garbage Collection
print('Example 1768')
