        Topic: Control Flow (variant 1782)
        Question: Describe Control Flow and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Control Flow is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving control flow.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
9. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
10. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Control Flow
print('Example 1782')
