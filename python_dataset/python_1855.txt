        Topic: Internationalization (i18n): Conceptual Overview
        Question: What are the key principles behind Internationalization (i18n) (Conceptual Overview)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Internationalization (i18n) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving internationalization (i18n).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
9. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
10. Document assumptions and usage examples.
11. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Internationalization (i18n)
print('Example 1855')
