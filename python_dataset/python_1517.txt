        Topic: Function Decorators (variant 1517)
        Question: Describe Function Decorators and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Function Decorators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving function decorators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Function Decorators
print('Example 1517')
