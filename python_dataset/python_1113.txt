        Topic: Garbage Collection: Performance Considerations
        Question: Explain the concept of Garbage Collection (Performance Considerations) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Garbage Collection is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving garbage collection.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Garbage Collection
print('Example 1113')
