        Topic: Recursion Basics: Short Tutorial
        Question: What are the key principles behind Recursion Basics (Short Tutorial)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Recursion Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving recursion basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n<=1 else n*factorial(n-1)
