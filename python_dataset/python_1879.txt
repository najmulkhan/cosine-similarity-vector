        Topic: Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) (variant 1879)
        Question: Describe Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
9. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort)
print('Example 1879')
