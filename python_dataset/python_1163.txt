        Topic: Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) (variant 1163)
        Question: How do you implement Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving data serialization (pickle, marshal).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Data Serialization (pickle, marshal)
print('Example 1163')
