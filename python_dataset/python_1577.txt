        Topic: NumPy Broadcasting: Advanced Techniques
        Question: Explain the concept of NumPy Broadcasting (Advanced Techniques) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        NumPy Broadcasting is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving numpy broadcasting.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating NumPy Broadcasting
print('Example 1577')
