        Topic: Caching Strategies (lru_cache): Performance Considerations (variant 973)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Caching Strategies (lru_cache) (Performance Considerations)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Caching Strategies (lru_cache) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving caching strategies (lru_cache).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Caching Strategies (lru_cache)
print('Example 973')
