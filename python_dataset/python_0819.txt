        Topic: Parsing Command Output: Practical Example
        Question: Describe Parsing Command Output (Practical Example) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Parsing Command Output is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving parsing command output.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Parsing Command Output
print('Example 819')
