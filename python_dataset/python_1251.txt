        Topic: Finite State Machines in Python: Implementation Walkthrough
        Question: Describe Finite State Machines in Python (Implementation Walkthrough) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Finite State Machines in Python is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving finite state machines in python.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Finite State Machines in Python
print('Example 1251')
