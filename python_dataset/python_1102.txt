        Topic: Dynamic Programming Concepts (variant 1102)
        Question: Explain the concept of Dynamic Programming Concepts and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Dynamic Programming Concepts is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving dynamic programming concepts.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Dynamic Programming Concepts
print('Example 1102')
