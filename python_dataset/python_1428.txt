        Topic: Garbage Collection: Performance Considerations (variant 1428)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Garbage Collection (Performance Considerations)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Garbage Collection is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving garbage collection.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Garbage Collection
print('Example 1428')
