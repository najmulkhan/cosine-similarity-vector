        Topic: Performance Profiling: Comparison with alternatives
        Question: Describe Performance Profiling (Comparison with alternatives) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Performance Profiling is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving performance profiling.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
9. Document assumptions and usage examples.
10. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Performance Profiling
print('Example 1812')
