        Topic: Algorithm Complexity (Big-O): Conceptual Overview
        Question: How does Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) (Conceptual Overview) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving algorithm complexity (big-o).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Algorithm Complexity (Big-O)
print('Example 312')
