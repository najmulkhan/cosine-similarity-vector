        Topic: Generators: Real-world Use Case (variant 1177)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Generators (Real-world Use Case)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Generators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Generators
print('Example 1177')
