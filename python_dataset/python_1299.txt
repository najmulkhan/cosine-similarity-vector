        Topic: Generators: Best Practices
        Question: What are the key principles behind Generators (Best Practices)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Generators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Generators
print('Example 1299')
