        Question: Describe Meta-programming (Cheat Sheet) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Meta-programming is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving meta-programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Meta-programming
