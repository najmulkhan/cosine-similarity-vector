        Topic: Recursion Basics: Step-by-Step
        Question: Explain the concept of Recursion Basics (Step-by-Step) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Recursion Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving recursion basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n<=1 else n*factorial(n-1)
