        Topic: Recursion Basics: Optimization Tips
        Question: How does Recursion Basics (Optimization Tips) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Recursion Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving recursion basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n<=1 else n*factorial(n-1)
