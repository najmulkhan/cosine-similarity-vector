        Topic: Rate Limiting: Cheat Sheet (variant 1315)
        Question: Describe Rate Limiting (Cheat Sheet) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Rate Limiting is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving rate limiting.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Rate Limiting
print('Example 1315')
