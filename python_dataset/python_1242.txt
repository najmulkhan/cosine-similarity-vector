        Topic: Circuit Breaker Patterns (variant 1242)
        Question: How does Circuit Breaker Patterns work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Circuit Breaker Patterns is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving circuit breaker patterns.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Circuit Breaker Patterns
print('Example 1242')
