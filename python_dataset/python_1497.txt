        Topic: Lambda Functions: Hands-on Example
        Question: What are the key principles behind Lambda Functions (Hands-on Example)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Lambda Functions is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving lambda functions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Lambda Functions
print('Example 1497')
