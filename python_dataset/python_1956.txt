        Topic: Regular Expressions: Common Mistakes
        Question: How does Regular Expressions (Common Mistakes) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Regular Expressions is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving regular expressions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
9. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
10. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Regular Expressions
print('Example 1956')
