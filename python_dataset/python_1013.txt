        Topic: Backoff and Retry Patterns: Real-world Use Case (variant 1013)
        Question: How do you implement Backoff and Retry Patterns (Real-world Use Case) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Backoff and Retry Patterns is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving backoff and retry patterns.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Backoff and Retry Patterns
print('Example 1013')
