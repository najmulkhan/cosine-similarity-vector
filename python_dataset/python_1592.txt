        Topic: Image Processing with PIL: Optimization Tips
        Question: How do you implement Image Processing with PIL (Optimization Tips) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Image Processing with PIL is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving image processing with pil.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Image Processing with PIL
print('Example 1592')
