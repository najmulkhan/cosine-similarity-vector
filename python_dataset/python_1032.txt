        Topic: Iterators: Conceptual Overview
        Question: Explain the concept of Iterators (Conceptual Overview) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Iterators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving iterators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Iterators
print('Example 1032')
