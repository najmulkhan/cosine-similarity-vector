        Topic: Regular Expressions: Best Practices (variant 1221)
        Question: How does Regular Expressions (Best Practices) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Regular Expressions is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving regular expressions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Regular Expressions
print('Example 1221')
