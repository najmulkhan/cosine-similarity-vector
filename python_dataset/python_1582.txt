        Topic: Async Generators: Step-by-Step
        Question: Describe Async Generators (Step-by-Step) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Async Generators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving async generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Async Generators
print('Example 1582')
