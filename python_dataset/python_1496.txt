        Topic: Refactoring Techniques: Implementation Walkthrough
        Question: What are the key principles behind Refactoring Techniques (Implementation Walkthrough)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Refactoring Techniques is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving refactoring techniques.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Refactoring Techniques
print('Example 1496')
