        Topic: Async Generators: Short Tutorial (variant 1268)
        Question: How does Async Generators (Short Tutorial) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Async Generators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving async generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Async Generators
print('Example 1268')
