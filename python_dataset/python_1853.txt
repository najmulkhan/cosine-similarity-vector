        Topic: Stacks and Queues: Edge Cases (variant 1853)
        Question: How do you implement Stacks and Queues (Edge Cases) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Stacks and Queues is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving stacks and queues.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Stacks and Queues
print('Example 1853')
