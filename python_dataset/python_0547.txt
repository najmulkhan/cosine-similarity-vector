        Topic: Meta-programming: Best Practices
        Question: What are the key principles behind Meta-programming (Best Practices)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Meta-programming is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving meta-programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Meta-programming
print('Example 547')
