        Topic: Variables and Data Types: Performance Considerations
        Question: How does Variables and Data Types (Performance Considerations) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Variables and Data Types is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving variables and data types.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        x = 5
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
