        Topic: Variables and Data Types: Cheat Sheet (variant 1543)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Variables and Data Types (Cheat Sheet)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Variables and Data Types is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving variables and data types.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        x = 5
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
