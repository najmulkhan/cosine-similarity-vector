        Topic: Asyncio Basics (variant 1010)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Asyncio Basics? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Asyncio Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving asyncio basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        import asyncio
async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
