        Topic: Recursion Basics: Short Tutorial (variant 1883)
        Question: Describe Recursion Basics (Short Tutorial) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Recursion Basics is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving recursion basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
9. Add tests to verify correctness.
10. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n<=1 else n*factorial(n-1)
