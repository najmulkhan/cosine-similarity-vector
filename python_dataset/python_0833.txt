        Topic: String Manipulation: Interview Question
        Question: What are the key principles behind String Manipulation (Interview Question)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        String Manipulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving string manipulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating String Manipulation
print('Example 833')
