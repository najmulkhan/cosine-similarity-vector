        Topic: Typing and Type Hints: Cheat Sheet
        Question: How do you implement Typing and Type Hints (Cheat Sheet) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Typing and Type Hints is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving typing and type hints.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
