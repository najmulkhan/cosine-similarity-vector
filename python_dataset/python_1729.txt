        Topic: Rate Limiting: Step-by-Step
        Question: What are the key principles behind Rate Limiting (Step-by-Step)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Rate Limiting is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving rate limiting.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Rate Limiting
print('Example 1729')
