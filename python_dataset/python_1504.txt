        Topic: Greedy Algorithms: Performance Considerations
        Question: Describe Greedy Algorithms (Performance Considerations) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Greedy Algorithms is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving greedy algorithms.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Greedy Algorithms
print('Example 1504')
