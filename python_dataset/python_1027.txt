        Topic: Typing and Type Hints: Security Considerations
        Question: What are the key principles behind Typing and Type Hints (Security Considerations)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Typing and Type Hints is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving typing and type hints.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
