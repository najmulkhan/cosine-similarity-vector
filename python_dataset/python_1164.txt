        Topic: Meta-programming: Practical Example
        Question: Describe Meta-programming (Practical Example) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Meta-programming is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving meta-programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Meta-programming
print('Example 1164')
