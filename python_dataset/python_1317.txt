        Topic: Reflection and inspect (variant 1317)
        Question: How do you implement Reflection and inspect in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Reflection and inspect is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving reflection and inspect.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Reflection and inspect
print('Example 1317')
