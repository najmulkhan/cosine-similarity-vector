        Topic: Internationalization (i18n)
        Question: Explain the concept of Internationalization (i18n) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Internationalization (i18n) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving internationalization (i18n).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Internationalization (i18n)
print('Example 1116')
