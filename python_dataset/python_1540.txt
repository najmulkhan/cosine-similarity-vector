        Topic: Error Handling and Exceptions (variant 1540)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Error Handling and Exceptions? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Error Handling and Exceptions is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving error handling and exceptions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Error Handling and Exceptions
print('Example 1540')
