        Topic: Seaborn for Visualization: Interview Question
        Question: What are the key principles behind Seaborn for Visualization (Interview Question)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Seaborn for Visualization is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving seaborn for visualization.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
9. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
10. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
11. Add tests to verify correctness.
12. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Seaborn for Visualization
print('Example 1658')
