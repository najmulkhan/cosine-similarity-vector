        Topic: Meta-programming: Real-world Use Case (variant 1223)
        Question: How does Meta-programming (Real-world Use Case) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Meta-programming is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving meta-programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Meta-programming
print('Example 1223')
