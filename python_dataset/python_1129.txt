        Topic: Asyncio Basics: Cheat Sheet (variant 1129)
        Question: How do you implement Asyncio Basics (Cheat Sheet) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Asyncio Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving asyncio basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        import asyncio
async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
