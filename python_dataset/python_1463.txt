        Topic: Meta-programming: Interview Question
        Question: Describe Meta-programming (Interview Question) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Meta-programming is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving meta-programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Meta-programming
print('Example 1463')
