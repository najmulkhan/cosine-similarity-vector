        Topic: Exponential Backoff: Hands-on Example
        Question: What are the key principles behind Exponential Backoff (Hands-on Example)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Exponential Backoff is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving exponential backoff.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
9. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Exponential Backoff
print('Example 1982')
