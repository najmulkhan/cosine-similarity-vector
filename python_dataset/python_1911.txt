        Topic: Stacks and Queues: Real-world Use Case
        Question: Explain the concept of Stacks and Queues (Real-world Use Case) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Stacks and Queues is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving stacks and queues.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.
9. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
10. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Stacks and Queues
print('Example 1911')
