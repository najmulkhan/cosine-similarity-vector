        Topic: Rate Limiting Strategies (variant 1910)
        Question: Describe Rate Limiting Strategies and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Rate Limiting Strategies is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving rate limiting strategies.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
9. Add tests to verify correctness.
10. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
11. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Rate Limiting Strategies
print('Example 1910')
