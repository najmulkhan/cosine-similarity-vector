        Topic: Exponential Backoff: Performance Considerations
        Question: What are the key principles behind Exponential Backoff (Performance Considerations)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Exponential Backoff is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving exponential backoff.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Exponential Backoff
print('Example 897')
