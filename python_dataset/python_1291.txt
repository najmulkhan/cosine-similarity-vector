        Topic: Asyncio Basics: Optimization Tips
        Question: How does Asyncio Basics (Optimization Tips) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Asyncio Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving asyncio basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        import asyncio
async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
