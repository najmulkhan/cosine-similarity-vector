        Topic: Finite State Machines in Python: Advanced Techniques
        Question: Explain the concept of Finite State Machines in Python (Advanced Techniques) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Finite State Machines in Python is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving finite state machines in python.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
9. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
10. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
11. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
12. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Finite State Machines in Python
print('Example 1784')
