        Topic: While Loops: Testing Strategies
        Question: What are the key principles behind While Loops (Testing Strategies)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        While Loops is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving while loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating While Loops
print('Example 328')
