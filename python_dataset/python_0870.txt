        Topic: Continuous Integration Basics: Optimization Tips
        Question: How do you implement Continuous Integration Basics (Optimization Tips) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Continuous Integration Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving continuous integration basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Continuous Integration Basics
print('Example 870')
