        Topic: Class Decorators (variant 1923)
        Question: Describe Class Decorators and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Class Decorators is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving class decorators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.
9. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
10. Document assumptions and usage examples.
11. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
12. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Class Decorators
print('Example 1923')
