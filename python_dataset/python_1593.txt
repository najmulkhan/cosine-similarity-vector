        Topic: Variable Scope: Edge Cases
        Question: Describe Variable Scope (Edge Cases) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Variable Scope is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving variable scope.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Variable Scope
print('Example 1593')
