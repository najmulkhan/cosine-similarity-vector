        Topic: For Loops: Interview Question
        Question: Describe For Loops (Interview Question) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        For Loops is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving for loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        for i in range(3):
    print(i)
