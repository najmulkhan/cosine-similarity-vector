        Topic: State Machines: Security Considerations
        Question: Explain the concept of State Machines (Security Considerations) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        State Machines is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving state machines.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
9. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating State Machines
print('Example 1701')
