        Topic: NumPy Broadcasting: Edge Cases (variant 427)
        Question: How do you implement NumPy Broadcasting (Edge Cases) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        NumPy Broadcasting is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving numpy broadcasting.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating NumPy Broadcasting
print('Example 427')
