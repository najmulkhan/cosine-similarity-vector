        Topic: Default Arguments: Cheat Sheet (variant 996)
        Question: Describe Default Arguments (Cheat Sheet) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Default Arguments is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving default arguments.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Default Arguments
print('Example 996')
