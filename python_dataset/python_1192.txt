        Topic: Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort): Hands-on Example
        Question: Describe Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) (Hands-on Example) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort)
print('Example 1192')
