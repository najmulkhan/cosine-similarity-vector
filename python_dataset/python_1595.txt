        Topic: Encapsulation: Security Considerations (variant 1595)
        Question: Describe Encapsulation (Security Considerations) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Encapsulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving encapsulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Encapsulation
print('Example 1595')
