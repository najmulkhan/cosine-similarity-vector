        Topic: Packaging Python Projects: Testing Strategies (variant 1971)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Packaging Python Projects (Testing Strategies)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Packaging Python Projects is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving packaging python projects.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Packaging Python Projects
print('Example 1971')
