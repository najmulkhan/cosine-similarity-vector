        Topic: Meta-programming: Real-world Use Case (variant 1211)
        Question: How do you implement Meta-programming (Real-world Use Case) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Meta-programming is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving meta-programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Meta-programming
print('Example 1211')
