        Topic: Garbage Collection: Performance Considerations (variant 1747)
        Question: Explain the concept of Garbage Collection (Performance Considerations) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Garbage Collection is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving garbage collection.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.
9. Document assumptions and usage examples.
10. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
11. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Garbage Collection
print('Example 1747')
