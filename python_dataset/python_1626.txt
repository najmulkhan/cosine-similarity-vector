        Topic: Magic Methods (__init__, __str__): Advanced Techniques
        Question: How do you implement Magic Methods (__init__, __str__) (Advanced Techniques) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Magic Methods (__init__, __str__) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving magic methods (__init__, __str__).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
9. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Magic Methods (__init__, __str__)
print('Example 1626')
