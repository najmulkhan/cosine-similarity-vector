        Topic: Parsing Command Output: Advanced Techniques
        Question: What are the key principles behind Parsing Command Output (Advanced Techniques)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Parsing Command Output is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving parsing command output.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Parsing Command Output
print('Example 1062')
