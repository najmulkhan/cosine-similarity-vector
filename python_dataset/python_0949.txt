        Topic: Sockets Programming: Best Practices (variant 949)
        Question: How do you implement Sockets Programming (Best Practices) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Sockets Programming is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving sockets programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',9000))
