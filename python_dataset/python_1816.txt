        Topic: Exponential Backoff: Advanced Techniques (variant 1816)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Exponential Backoff (Advanced Techniques)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Exponential Backoff is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving exponential backoff.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.
9. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
10. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
11. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Exponential Backoff
print('Example 1816')
