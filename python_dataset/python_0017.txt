        Topic: Greedy Algorithms: Common Mistakes
        Question: How do you implement Greedy Algorithms (Common Mistakes) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Greedy Algorithms is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving greedy algorithms.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Greedy Algorithms
print('Example 17')
