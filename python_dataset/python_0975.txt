        Topic: Localization (l10n): Common Mistakes
        Question: How do you implement Localization (l10n) (Common Mistakes) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Localization (l10n) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving localization (l10n).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Localization (l10n)
print('Example 975')
