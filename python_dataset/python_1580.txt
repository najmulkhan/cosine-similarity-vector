        Topic: APIs and JSON: Step-by-Step (variant 1580)
        Question: Describe APIs and JSON (Step-by-Step) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        APIs and JSON is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving apis and json.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
