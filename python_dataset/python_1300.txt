        Topic: Environment Variables: Step-by-Step
        Question: Describe Environment Variables (Step-by-Step) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Environment Variables is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving environment variables.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Environment Variables
print('Example 1300')
