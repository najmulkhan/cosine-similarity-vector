        Topic: File I/O (variant 1000)
        Question: What are the key principles behind File I/O? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        File I/O is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving file i/o.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        with open('data.txt') as f:
    text = f.read()
