        Topic: Debugging Techniques: Best Practices (variant 1581)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Debugging Techniques (Best Practices)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Debugging Techniques is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving debugging techniques.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Debugging Techniques
print('Example 1581')
