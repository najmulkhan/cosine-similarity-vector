        Topic: File I/O: Common Mistakes (variant 1020)
        Question: What are the key principles behind File I/O (Common Mistakes)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        File I/O is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving file i/o.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        with open('data.txt') as f:
    text = f.read()
