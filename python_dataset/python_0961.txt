        Topic: String Manipulation: Short Tutorial
        Question: What are the key principles behind String Manipulation (Short Tutorial)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        String Manipulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving string manipulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating String Manipulation
print('Example 961')
