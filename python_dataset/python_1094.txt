        Topic: Control Flow: Advanced Techniques (variant 1094)
        Question: How does Control Flow (Advanced Techniques) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Control Flow is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving control flow.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Control Flow
print('Example 1094')
