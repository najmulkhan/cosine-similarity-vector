        Topic: Sockets Programming (variant 1247)
        Question: Describe Sockets Programming and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Sockets Programming is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving sockets programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',9000))
