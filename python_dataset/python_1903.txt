        Topic: Concurrency vs Parallelism: Edge Cases
        Question: How do you implement Concurrency vs Parallelism (Edge Cases) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Concurrency vs Parallelism is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving concurrency vs parallelism.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Concurrency vs Parallelism
print('Example 1903')
