        Topic: Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) (variant 1917)
        Question: How does Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort)
print('Example 1917')
