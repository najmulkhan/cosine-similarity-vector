        Topic: Timezone Handling: Advanced Techniques (variant 1114)
        Question: Describe Timezone Handling (Advanced Techniques) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Timezone Handling is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving timezone handling.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Timezone Handling
print('Example 1114')
