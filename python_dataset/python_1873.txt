        Topic: Generators: Conceptual Overview
        Question: Describe Generators (Conceptual Overview) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Generators is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Generators
print('Example 1873')
