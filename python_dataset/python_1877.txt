        Topic: Algorithm Complexity (Big-O): Practical Example
        Question: Explain the concept of Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) (Practical Example) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving algorithm complexity (big-o).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Algorithm Complexity (Big-O)
print('Example 1877')
