        Topic: Matplotlib Basic Plots (variant 1972)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Matplotlib Basic Plots? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Matplotlib Basic Plots is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving matplotlib basic plots.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Matplotlib Basic Plots
print('Example 1972')
