        Topic: Data Serialization (pickle, marshal): Hands-on Example
        Question: What are the key principles behind Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) (Hands-on Example)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving data serialization (pickle, marshal).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Data Serialization (pickle, marshal)
print('Example 1432')
