        Topic: Internationalization (i18n): Comparison with alternatives
        Question: How do you implement Internationalization (i18n) (Comparison with alternatives) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Internationalization (i18n) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving internationalization (i18n).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Internationalization (i18n)
print('Example 1016')
