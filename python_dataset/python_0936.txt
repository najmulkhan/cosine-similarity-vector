        Topic: Sockets Programming: Testing Strategies
        Question: How do you implement Sockets Programming (Testing Strategies) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Sockets Programming is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving sockets programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',9000))
