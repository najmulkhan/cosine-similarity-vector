        Topic: Iterators: Comparison with alternatives
        Question: How does Iterators (Comparison with alternatives) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Iterators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving iterators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Iterators
print('Example 1063')
