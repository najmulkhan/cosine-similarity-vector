        Topic: For Loops: Security Considerations
        Question: How do you implement For Loops (Security Considerations) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        For Loops is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving for loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        for i in range(3):
    print(i)
