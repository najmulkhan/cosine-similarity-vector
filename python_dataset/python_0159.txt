        Topic: Algorithm Complexity (Big-O): Short Tutorial
        Question: What are the key principles behind Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) (Short Tutorial)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving algorithm complexity (big-o).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Algorithm Complexity (Big-O)
print('Example 159')
