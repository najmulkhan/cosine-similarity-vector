        Topic: Security Basics (Input Sanitization): Real-world Use Case (variant 864)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Security Basics (Input Sanitization) (Real-world Use Case)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Security Basics (Input Sanitization) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving security basics (input sanitization).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Security Basics (Input Sanitization)
print('Example 864')
