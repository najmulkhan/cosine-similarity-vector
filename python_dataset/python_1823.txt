        Topic: Recursion Basics: Performance Considerations (variant 1823)
        Question: Explain the concept of Recursion Basics (Performance Considerations) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Recursion Basics is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving recursion basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n<=1 else n*factorial(n-1)
