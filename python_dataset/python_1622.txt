        Topic: Rate Limiting Strategies: Optimization Tips
        Question: How do you implement Rate Limiting Strategies (Optimization Tips) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Rate Limiting Strategies is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving rate limiting strategies.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Rate Limiting Strategies
print('Example 1622')
