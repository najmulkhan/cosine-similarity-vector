        Topic: Dependency Injection Basics: Performance Considerations (variant 1255)
        Question: How does Dependency Injection Basics (Performance Considerations) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Dependency Injection Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving dependency injection basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Dependency Injection Basics
print('Example 1255')
