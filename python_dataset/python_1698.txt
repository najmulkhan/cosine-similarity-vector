        Topic: File I/O: Implementation Walkthrough (variant 1698)
        Question: Explain the concept of File I/O (Implementation Walkthrough) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        File I/O is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving file i/o.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
9. Document assumptions and usage examples.
10. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
11. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        with open('data.txt') as f:
    text = f.read()
