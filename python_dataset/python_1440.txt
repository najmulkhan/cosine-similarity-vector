        Topic: Searching Algorithms (Binary Search): Common Mistakes
        Question: What are the key principles behind Searching Algorithms (Binary Search) (Common Mistakes)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Searching Algorithms (Binary Search) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving searching algorithms (binary search).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Searching Algorithms (Binary Search)
print('Example 1440')
