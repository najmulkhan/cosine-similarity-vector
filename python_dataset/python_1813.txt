        Topic: NumPy Arrays Basics: Common Mistakes
        Question: Describe NumPy Arrays Basics (Common Mistakes) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        NumPy Arrays Basics is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving numpy arrays basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1,2,3])
