        Topic: Greedy Algorithms: Security Considerations
        Question: Describe Greedy Algorithms (Security Considerations) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Greedy Algorithms is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving greedy algorithms.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Greedy Algorithms
print('Example 641')
