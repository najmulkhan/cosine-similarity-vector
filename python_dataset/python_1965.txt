        Topic: Rate Limiting Strategies: Comparison with alternatives (variant 1965)
        Question: Describe Rate Limiting Strategies (Comparison with alternatives) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Rate Limiting Strategies is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving rate limiting strategies.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.
9. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
10. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
11. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Rate Limiting Strategies
print('Example 1965')
