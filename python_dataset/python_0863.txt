        Topic: Rate Limiting Strategies: Hands-on Example
        Question: How does Rate Limiting Strategies (Hands-on Example) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Rate Limiting Strategies is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving rate limiting strategies.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Rate Limiting Strategies
print('Example 863')
