        Topic: While Loops: Best Practices
        Question: What are the key principles behind While Loops (Best Practices)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        While Loops is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving while loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating While Loops
print('Example 1875')
