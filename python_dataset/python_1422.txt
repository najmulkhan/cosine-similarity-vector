        Topic: Regular Expressions: In-depth Explanation
        Question: How do you implement Regular Expressions (In-depth Explanation) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Regular Expressions is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving regular expressions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Regular Expressions
print('Example 1422')
