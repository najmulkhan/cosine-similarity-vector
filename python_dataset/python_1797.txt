        Topic: Configuration Management: Advanced Techniques (variant 1797)
        Question: Describe Configuration Management (Advanced Techniques) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Configuration Management is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving configuration management.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Configuration Management
print('Example 1797')
