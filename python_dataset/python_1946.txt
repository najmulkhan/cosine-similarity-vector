        Topic: Debugging Techniques: Advanced Techniques (variant 1946)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Debugging Techniques (Advanced Techniques)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Debugging Techniques is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving debugging techniques.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
9. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
10. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
11. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
12. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Debugging Techniques
print('Example 1946')
