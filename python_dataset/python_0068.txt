        Topic: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics: Testing Strategies
        Question: Describe Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics (Testing Strategies) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving object-oriented programming (oop) basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics
print('Example 68')
