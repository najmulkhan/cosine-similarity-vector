        Topic: Circuit Breaker Patterns: Interview Question
        Question: Describe Circuit Breaker Patterns (Interview Question) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Circuit Breaker Patterns is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving circuit breaker patterns.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Circuit Breaker Patterns
print('Example 1330')
