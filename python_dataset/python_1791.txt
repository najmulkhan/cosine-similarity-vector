        Topic: Exponential Backoff: Security Considerations
        Question: Describe Exponential Backoff (Security Considerations) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Exponential Backoff is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving exponential backoff.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
9. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
10. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
11. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
12. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Exponential Backoff
print('Example 1791')
