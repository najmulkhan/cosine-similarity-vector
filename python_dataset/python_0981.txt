        Topic: Debugging Techniques: Security Considerations
        Question: Describe Debugging Techniques (Security Considerations) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Debugging Techniques is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving debugging techniques.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Debugging Techniques
print('Example 981')
