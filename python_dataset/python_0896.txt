        Topic: Internationalization (i18n): Common Mistakes
        Question: Describe Internationalization (i18n) (Common Mistakes) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Internationalization (i18n) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving internationalization (i18n).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Internationalization (i18n)
print('Example 896')
