        Topic: File I/O: Edge Cases
        Question: What are the key principles behind File I/O (Edge Cases)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        File I/O is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving file i/o.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        with open('data.txt') as f:
    text = f.read()
