        Topic: Parsing Command Output: Advanced Techniques (variant 1694)
        Question: How do you implement Parsing Command Output (Advanced Techniques) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Parsing Command Output is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving parsing command output.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Parsing Command Output
print('Example 1694')
