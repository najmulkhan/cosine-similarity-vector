        Topic: Operators: Practical Example
        Question: Explain the concept of Operators (Practical Example) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Operators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving operators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Operators
