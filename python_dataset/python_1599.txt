        Topic: Refactoring Techniques: Real-world Use Case
        Question: How do you implement Refactoring Techniques (Real-world Use Case) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Refactoring Techniques is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving refactoring techniques.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Refactoring Techniques
print('Example 1599')
