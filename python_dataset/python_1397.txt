        Topic: Async Generators (variant 1397)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Async Generators? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Async Generators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving async generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Async Generators
print('Example 1397')
