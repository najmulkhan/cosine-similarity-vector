        Topic: Reflection and inspect: Interview Question
        Question: Explain the concept of Reflection and inspect (Interview Question) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Reflection and inspect is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving reflection and inspect.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Reflection and inspect
print('Example 1644')
