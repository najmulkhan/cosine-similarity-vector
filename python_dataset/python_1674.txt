        Topic: Caching Strategies (lru_cache): Practical Example
        Question: What are the key principles behind Caching Strategies (lru_cache) (Practical Example)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Caching Strategies (lru_cache) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving caching strategies (lru_cache).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.
9. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
10. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
11. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Caching Strategies (lru_cache)
print('Example 1674')
