        Topic: Descriptors
        Question: Describe Descriptors and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Descriptors is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving descriptors.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Descriptors
print('Example 1167')
