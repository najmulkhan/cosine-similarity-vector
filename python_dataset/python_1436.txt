        Topic: Functions and Parameters: Comparison with alternatives
        Question: What are the key principles behind Functions and Parameters (Comparison with alternatives)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Functions and Parameters is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving functions and parameters.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Functions and Parameters
print('Example 1436')
