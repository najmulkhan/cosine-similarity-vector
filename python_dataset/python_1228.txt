        Topic: Generators (variant 1228)
        Question: How does Generators work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Generators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Generators
print('Example 1228')
