        Topic: Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort): Interview Question (variant 1839)
        Question: How do you implement Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) (Interview Question) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.
9. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
10. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
11. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort)
print('Example 1839')
