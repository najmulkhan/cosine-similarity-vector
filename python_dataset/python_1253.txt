        Topic: Functions and Parameters: Common Mistakes
        Question: What are the key principles behind Functions and Parameters (Common Mistakes)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Functions and Parameters is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving functions and parameters.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Functions and Parameters
print('Example 1253')
