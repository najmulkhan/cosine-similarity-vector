        Topic: Caching Strategies (lru_cache): Step-by-Step
        Question: How does Caching Strategies (lru_cache) (Step-by-Step) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Caching Strategies (lru_cache) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving caching strategies (lru_cache).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Caching Strategies (lru_cache)
print('Example 1118')
