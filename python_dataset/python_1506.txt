        Topic: Image Processing with PIL: Security Considerations (variant 1506)
        Question: How does Image Processing with PIL (Security Considerations) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Image Processing with PIL is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving image processing with pil.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Image Processing with PIL
print('Example 1506')
