        Question: How does File I/O (Practical Example) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        File I/O is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving file i/o.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
