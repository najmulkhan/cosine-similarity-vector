        Topic: Class Decorators: Hands-on Example
        Question: What are the key principles behind Class Decorators (Hands-on Example)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Class Decorators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving class decorators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Class Decorators
