        Topic: Classes and Objects: Best Practices
        Question: Describe Classes and Objects (Best Practices) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Classes and Objects is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving classes and objects.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.
9. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Classes and Objects
print('Example 1624')
