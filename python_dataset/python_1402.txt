        Topic: Algorithm Complexity (Big-O): Short Tutorial (variant 1402)
        Question: How does Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) (Short Tutorial) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving algorithm complexity (big-o).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Algorithm Complexity (Big-O)
print('Example 1402')
