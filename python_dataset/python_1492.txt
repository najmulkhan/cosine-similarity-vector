        Topic: Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton): Advanced Techniques (variant 1492)
        Question: Describe Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) (Advanced Techniques) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving design patterns (factory, singleton).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton)
print('Example 1492')
