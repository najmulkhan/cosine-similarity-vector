        Topic: Algorithm Complexity (Big-O): Testing Strategies
        Question: What are the key principles behind Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) (Testing Strategies)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving algorithm complexity (big-o).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Algorithm Complexity (Big-O)
print('Example 1202')
