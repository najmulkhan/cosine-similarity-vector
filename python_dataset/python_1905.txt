        Topic: Variables and Data Types: Testing Strategies (variant 1905)
        Question: How do you implement Variables and Data Types (Testing Strategies) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Variables and Data Types is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving variables and data types.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        x = 5
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
