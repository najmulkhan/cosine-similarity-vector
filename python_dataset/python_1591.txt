        Topic: Operators: Real-world Use Case (variant 1591)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Operators (Real-world Use Case)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Operators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving operators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Operators
print('Example 1591')
