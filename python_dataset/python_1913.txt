        Topic: Configuration Management: Practical Example (variant 1913)
        Question: Describe Configuration Management (Practical Example) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Configuration Management is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving configuration management.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.
9. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Configuration Management
print('Example 1913')
