        Topic: Algorithm Complexity (Big-O): Hands-on Example
        Question: How do you implement Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) (Hands-on Example) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving algorithm complexity (big-o).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Algorithm Complexity (Big-O)
print('Example 761')
