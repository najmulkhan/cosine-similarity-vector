        Topic: Exponential Backoff: Edge Cases (variant 1781)
        Question: Explain the concept of Exponential Backoff (Edge Cases) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Exponential Backoff is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving exponential backoff.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
9. Document assumptions and usage examples.
10. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
11. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
12. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Exponential Backoff
print('Example 1781')
