        Topic: Working with CSV: Step-by-Step
        Question: What are the key principles behind Working with CSV (Step-by-Step)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Working with CSV is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving working with csv.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
9. Add tests to verify correctness.
10. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
11. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
12. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
