        Topic: Matplotlib Basic Plots: Common Mistakes (variant 1573)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Matplotlib Basic Plots (Common Mistakes)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Matplotlib Basic Plots is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving matplotlib basic plots.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Matplotlib Basic Plots
print('Example 1573')
