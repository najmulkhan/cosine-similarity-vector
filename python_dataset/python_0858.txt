        Topic: Reflection and inspect
        Question: Explain the concept of Reflection and inspect and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Reflection and inspect is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving reflection and inspect.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Reflection and inspect
print('Example 858')
