        Topic: Function Decorators: Testing Strategies
        Question: How does Function Decorators (Testing Strategies) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Function Decorators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving function decorators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Function Decorators
print('Example 1574')
