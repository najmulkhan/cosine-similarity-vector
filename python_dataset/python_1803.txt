        Topic: Contextvars: Comparison with alternatives (variant 1803)
        Question: Describe Contextvars (Comparison with alternatives) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Contextvars is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving contextvars.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Contextvars
print('Example 1803')
