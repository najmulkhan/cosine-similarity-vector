        Topic: If Statements: Performance Considerations
        Question: How does If Statements (Performance Considerations) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        If Statements is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving if statements.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating If Statements
print('Example 1155')
