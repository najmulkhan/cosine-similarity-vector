        Topic: Rate Limiting Strategies: Comparison with alternatives (variant 1994)
        Question: Explain the concept of Rate Limiting Strategies (Comparison with alternatives) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Rate Limiting Strategies is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving rate limiting strategies.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
9. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
10. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
11. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Rate Limiting Strategies
print('Example 1994')
