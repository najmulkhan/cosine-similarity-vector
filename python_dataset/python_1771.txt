        Topic: Caching Strategies (lru_cache): Best Practices
        Question: How do you implement Caching Strategies (lru_cache) (Best Practices) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Caching Strategies (lru_cache) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving caching strategies (lru_cache).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Caching Strategies (lru_cache)
print('Example 1771')
