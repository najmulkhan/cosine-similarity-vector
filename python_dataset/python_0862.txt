        Topic: Greedy Algorithms: Interview Question
        Question: Describe Greedy Algorithms (Interview Question) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Greedy Algorithms is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving greedy algorithms.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Greedy Algorithms
print('Example 862')
