        Topic: Sockets Programming: Practical Example (variant 887)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Sockets Programming (Practical Example)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Sockets Programming is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving sockets programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',9000))
