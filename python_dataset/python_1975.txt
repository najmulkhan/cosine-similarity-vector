        Topic: Performance Profiling: Practical Example (variant 1975)
        Question: Explain the concept of Performance Profiling (Practical Example) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Performance Profiling is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving performance profiling.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Performance Profiling
print('Example 1975')
