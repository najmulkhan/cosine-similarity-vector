        Topic: Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort): In-depth Explanation (variant 1878)
        Question: How do you implement Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) (In-depth Explanation) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort)
print('Example 1878')
