        Topic: For Loops: In-depth Explanation (variant 1922)
        Question: How does For Loops (In-depth Explanation) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        For Loops is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving for loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
9. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
10. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
11. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
12. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        for i in range(3):
    print(i)
