        Topic: Inheritance and Polymorphism: Performance Considerations
        Question: How does Inheritance and Polymorphism (Performance Considerations) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Inheritance and Polymorphism is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving inheritance and polymorphism.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Inheritance and Polymorphism
print('Example 556')
