        Topic: Pandas Data Manipulation: Practical Example
        Question: Describe Pandas Data Manipulation (Practical Example) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Pandas Data Manipulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving pandas data manipulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Pandas Data Manipulation
print('Example 859')
