        Topic: Greedy Algorithms: In-depth Explanation (variant 1364)
        Question: Explain the concept of Greedy Algorithms (In-depth Explanation) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Greedy Algorithms is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving greedy algorithms.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Greedy Algorithms
print('Example 1364')
