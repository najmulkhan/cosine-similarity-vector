        Topic: Async Generators: Real-world Use Case
        Question: How do you implement Async Generators (Real-world Use Case) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Async Generators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving async generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Async Generators
print('Example 875')
