        Topic: Sockets Programming: Performance Considerations
        Question: How does Sockets Programming (Performance Considerations) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Sockets Programming is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving sockets programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',9000))
