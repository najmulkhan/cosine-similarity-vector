        Topic: Testing with pytest: Testing Strategies (variant 1347)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Testing with pytest (Testing Strategies)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Testing with pytest is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving testing with pytest.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Testing with pytest
print('Example 1347')
