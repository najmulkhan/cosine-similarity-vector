        Topic: Lambda Functions: Real-world Use Case
        Question: What are the key principles behind Lambda Functions (Real-world Use Case)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Lambda Functions is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving lambda functions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Lambda Functions
print('Example 128')
