        Topic: Performance Profiling: Cheat Sheet (variant 1520)
        Question: Explain the concept of Performance Profiling (Cheat Sheet) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Performance Profiling is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving performance profiling.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
