        Topic: Dataclasses: Step-by-Step
        Question: What are the key principles behind Dataclasses (Step-by-Step)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Dataclasses is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving dataclasses.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Dataclasses
print('Example 303')
