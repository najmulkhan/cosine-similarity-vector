        Topic: Reflection and inspect (variant 1885)
        Question: Describe Reflection and inspect and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Reflection and inspect is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving reflection and inspect.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Reflection and inspect
print('Example 1885')
