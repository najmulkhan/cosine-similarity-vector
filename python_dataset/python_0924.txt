        Topic: Async Generators: Short Tutorial
        Question: Explain the concept of Async Generators (Short Tutorial) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Async Generators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving async generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Async Generators
print('Example 924')
