        Topic: Sockets Programming: Real-world Use Case (variant 760)
        Question: How do you implement Sockets Programming (Real-world Use Case) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Sockets Programming is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving sockets programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',9000))
