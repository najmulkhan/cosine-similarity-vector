        Topic: Reflection and inspect: Practical Example
        Question: What are the key principles behind Reflection and inspect (Practical Example)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Reflection and inspect is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving reflection and inspect.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Reflection and inspect
print('Example 1208')
