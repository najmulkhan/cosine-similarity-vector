        Topic: Properties and Getters: Best Practices
        Question: How do you implement Properties and Getters (Best Practices) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Properties and Getters is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving properties and getters.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
