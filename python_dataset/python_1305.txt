        Topic: String Manipulation (variant 1305)
        Question: How does String Manipulation work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        String Manipulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving string manipulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating String Manipulation
print('Example 1305')
