        Topic: Algorithm Complexity (Big-O)
        Question: How do you implement Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving algorithm complexity (big-o).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Algorithm Complexity (Big-O)
print('Example 764')
