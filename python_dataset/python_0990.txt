        Topic: Iterators: Real-world Use Case
        Question: How does Iterators (Real-world Use Case) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Iterators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving iterators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Iterators
print('Example 990')
