        Topic: Dependency Injection Basics: Performance Considerations
        Question: Describe Dependency Injection Basics (Performance Considerations) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Dependency Injection Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving dependency injection basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Dependency Injection Basics
print('Example 956')
