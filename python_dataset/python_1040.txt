        Topic: Memory Management: Testing Strategies
        Question: What are the key principles behind Memory Management (Testing Strategies)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Memory Management is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving memory management.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Memory Management
print('Example 1040')
