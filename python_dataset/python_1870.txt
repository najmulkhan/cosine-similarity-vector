        Topic: Logging Best Practices (variant 1870)
        Question: How do you implement Logging Best Practices in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Logging Best Practices is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving logging best practices.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
9. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
10. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
11. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
12. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Logging Best Practices
print('Example 1870')
