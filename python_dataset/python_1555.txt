        Topic: String Manipulation: Cheat Sheet
        Question: What are the key principles behind String Manipulation (Cheat Sheet)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        String Manipulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving string manipulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
