        Topic: Debugging Techniques (variant 892)
        Question: How do you implement Debugging Techniques in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Debugging Techniques is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving debugging techniques.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Debugging Techniques
print('Example 892')
