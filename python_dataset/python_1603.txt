        Topic: Dataclasses: Common Mistakes
        Question: Explain the concept of Dataclasses (Common Mistakes) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Dataclasses is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving dataclasses.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Dataclasses
print('Example 1603')
