        Topic: Refactoring Techniques: Short Tutorial
        Question: What are the key principles behind Refactoring Techniques (Short Tutorial)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Refactoring Techniques is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving refactoring techniques.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Refactoring Techniques
print('Example 937')
