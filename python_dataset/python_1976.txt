        Topic: Iterators: Security Considerations (variant 1976)
        Question: Describe Iterators (Security Considerations) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Iterators is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving iterators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Iterators
print('Example 1976')
