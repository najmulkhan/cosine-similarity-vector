        Topic: Environment Variables: Best Practices
        Question: Describe Environment Variables (Best Practices) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Environment Variables is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving environment variables.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Environment Variables
print('Example 944')
