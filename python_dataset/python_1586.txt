        Topic: Function Decorators: Best Practices (variant 1586)
        Question: Describe Function Decorators (Best Practices) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Function Decorators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving function decorators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Function Decorators
print('Example 1586')
