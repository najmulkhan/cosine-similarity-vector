        Topic: Recursion Basics: Testing Strategies
        Question: How do you implement Recursion Basics (Testing Strategies) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Recursion Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving recursion basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n<=1 else n*factorial(n-1)
