        Topic: NumPy Arrays Basics: Comparison with alternatives (variant 1597)
        Question: What are the key principles behind NumPy Arrays Basics (Comparison with alternatives)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        NumPy Arrays Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving numpy arrays basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1,2,3])
