        Topic: Functions and Parameters (variant 1072)
        Question: Describe Functions and Parameters and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Functions and Parameters is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving functions and parameters.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Functions and Parameters
print('Example 1072')
