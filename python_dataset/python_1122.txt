        Topic: Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton): Practical Example (variant 1122)
        Question: Explain the concept of Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) (Practical Example) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving design patterns (factory, singleton).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton)
print('Example 1122')
