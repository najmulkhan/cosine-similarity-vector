        Topic: Debugging Techniques: Advanced Techniques (variant 1535)
        Question: Describe Debugging Techniques (Advanced Techniques) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Debugging Techniques is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving debugging techniques.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Debugging Techniques
print('Example 1535')
