        Topic: String Manipulation: Security Considerations
        Question: How do you implement String Manipulation (Security Considerations) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        String Manipulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving string manipulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating String Manipulation
print('Example 822')
