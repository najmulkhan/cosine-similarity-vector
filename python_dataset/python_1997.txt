        Topic: Sockets Programming: Implementation Walkthrough
        Question: Describe Sockets Programming (Implementation Walkthrough) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Sockets Programming is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving sockets programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
9. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
10. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
11. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',9000))
