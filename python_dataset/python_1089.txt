        Topic: Performance Profiling: Cheat Sheet
        Question: What are the key principles behind Performance Profiling (Cheat Sheet)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Performance Profiling is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving performance profiling.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Performance Profiling
print('Example 1089')
