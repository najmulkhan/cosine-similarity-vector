        Topic: Function Decorators: Cheat Sheet
        Question: Explain the concept of Function Decorators (Cheat Sheet) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Function Decorators is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving function decorators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
9. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
10. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
11. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
12. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Function Decorators
print('Example 1985')
