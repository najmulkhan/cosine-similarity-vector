        Topic: Dependency Injection Basics: Edge Cases
        Question: How do you implement Dependency Injection Basics (Edge Cases) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Dependency Injection Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving dependency injection basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Dependency Injection Basics
print('Example 1201')
