        Topic: Properties and Getters: Best Practices (variant 1190)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Properties and Getters (Best Practices)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Properties and Getters is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving properties and getters.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Properties and Getters
print('Example 1190')
