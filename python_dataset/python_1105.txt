        Topic: Exponential Backoff: Conceptual Overview
        Question: What are the key principles behind Exponential Backoff (Conceptual Overview)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Exponential Backoff is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving exponential backoff.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Exponential Backoff
print('Example 1105')
