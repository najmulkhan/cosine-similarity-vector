        Topic: Searching Algorithms (Binary Search): Testing Strategies
        Question: How do you implement Searching Algorithms (Binary Search) (Testing Strategies) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Searching Algorithms (Binary Search) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving searching algorithms (binary search).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Searching Algorithms (Binary Search)
print('Example 1008')
