        Topic: Regular Expressions: Performance Considerations
        Question: What are the key principles behind Regular Expressions (Performance Considerations)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Regular Expressions is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving regular expressions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Regular Expressions
print('Example 1298')
