        Topic: Function Decorators: Best Practices
        Question: What are the key principles behind Function Decorators (Best Practices)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Function Decorators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving function decorators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Function Decorators
print('Example 1483')
