        Question: How does Dockerizing Python Apps (Advanced Techniques) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Dockerizing Python Apps is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving dockerizing python apps.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
