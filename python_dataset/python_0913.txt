        Topic: State Machines: Hands-on Example
        Question: How do you implement State Machines (Hands-on Example) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        State Machines is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving state machines.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating State Machines
print('Example 913')
