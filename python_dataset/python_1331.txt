        Topic: APIs and JSON: Short Tutorial (variant 1331)
        Question: Describe APIs and JSON (Short Tutorial) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        APIs and JSON is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving apis and json.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating APIs and JSON
print('Example 1331')
