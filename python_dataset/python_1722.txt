        Topic: Meta-programming: Best Practices (variant 1722)
        Question: How does Meta-programming (Best Practices) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Meta-programming is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving meta-programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Meta-programming
print('Example 1722')
