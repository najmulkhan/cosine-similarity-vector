        Topic: Trees (Binary Trees Basics) (variant 1702)
        Question: Describe Trees (Binary Trees Basics) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Trees (Binary Trees Basics) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving trees (binary trees basics).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
9. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
10. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
11. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
