        Topic: Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton): Practical Example
        Question: Explain the concept of Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) (Practical Example) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving design patterns (factory, singleton).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton)
print('Example 1080')
