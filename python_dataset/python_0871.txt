        Topic: Variables and Data Types: Cheat Sheet
        Question: How do you implement Variables and Data Types (Cheat Sheet) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Variables and Data Types is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving variables and data types.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        x = 5
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
