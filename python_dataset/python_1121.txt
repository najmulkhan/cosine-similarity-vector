        Topic: Finite State Machines in Python (variant 1121)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Finite State Machines in Python? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Finite State Machines in Python is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving finite state machines in python.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Finite State Machines in Python
print('Example 1121')
