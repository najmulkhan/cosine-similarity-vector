        Topic: For Loops (variant 1544)
        Question: What are the key principles behind For Loops? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        For Loops is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving for loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        for i in range(3):
    print(i)
