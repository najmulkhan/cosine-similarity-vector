        Topic: Finite State Machines in Python: Performance Considerations
        Question: How do you implement Finite State Machines in Python (Performance Considerations) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Finite State Machines in Python is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving finite state machines in python.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Finite State Machines in Python
print('Example 1566')
