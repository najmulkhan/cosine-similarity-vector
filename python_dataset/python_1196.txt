        Topic: Decorators Basics: Performance Considerations (variant 1196)
        Question: Describe Decorators Basics (Performance Considerations) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Decorators Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving decorators basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        def deco(f):
    def wrapper():
        print('before')
        f()
    return wrapper
