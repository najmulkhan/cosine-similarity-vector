        Topic: Generators: Real-world Use Case
        Question: Describe Generators (Real-world Use Case) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Generators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Generators
print('Example 1158')
