        Topic: Finite State Machines in Python: Conceptual Overview
        Question: Describe Finite State Machines in Python (Conceptual Overview) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Finite State Machines in Python is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving finite state machines in python.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Finite State Machines in Python
print('Example 289')
