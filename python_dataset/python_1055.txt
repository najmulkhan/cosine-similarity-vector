        Topic: Greedy Algorithms: In-depth Explanation
        Question: What are the key principles behind Greedy Algorithms (In-depth Explanation)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Greedy Algorithms is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving greedy algorithms.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Greedy Algorithms
print('Example 1055')
