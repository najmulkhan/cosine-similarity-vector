        Topic: Asyncio Basics: In-depth Explanation
        Question: Describe Asyncio Basics (In-depth Explanation) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Asyncio Basics is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving asyncio basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        import asyncio
async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
