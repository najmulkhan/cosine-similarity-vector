        Topic: State Machines: Conceptual Overview (variant 1524)
        Question: Describe State Machines (Conceptual Overview) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        State Machines is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving state machines.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating State Machines
print('Example 1524')
