        Topic: File I/O: Performance Considerations
        Question: Describe File I/O (Performance Considerations) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        File I/O is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving file i/o.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        with open('data.txt') as f:
    text = f.read()
