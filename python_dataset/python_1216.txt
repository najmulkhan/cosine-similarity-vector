        Topic: Lambda Functions (variant 1216)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Lambda Functions? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Lambda Functions is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving lambda functions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Lambda Functions
print('Example 1216')
