        Topic: Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton): Best Practices
        Question: Describe Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) (Best Practices) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving design patterns (factory, singleton).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton)
print('Example 1409')
