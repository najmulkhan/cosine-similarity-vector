        Topic: Performance Profiling: Edge Cases (variant 1998)
        Question: Describe Performance Profiling (Edge Cases) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Performance Profiling is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving performance profiling.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.
9. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
10. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
11. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
12. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Performance Profiling
print('Example 1998')
