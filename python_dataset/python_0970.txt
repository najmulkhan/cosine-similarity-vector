        Topic: Algorithm Complexity (Big-O): Edge Cases
        Question: How does Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) (Edge Cases) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving algorithm complexity (big-o).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Algorithm Complexity (Big-O)
print('Example 970')
