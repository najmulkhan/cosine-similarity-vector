        Topic: String Manipulation: Step-by-Step (variant 1921)
        Question: Explain the concept of String Manipulation (Step-by-Step) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        String Manipulation is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving string manipulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
9. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
10. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
11. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
12. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating String Manipulation
print('Example 1921')
