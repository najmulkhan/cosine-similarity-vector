        Topic: Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort): Step-by-Step
        Question: What are the key principles behind Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) (Step-by-Step)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort)
print('Example 1461')
