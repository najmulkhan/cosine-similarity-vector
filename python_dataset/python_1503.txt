        Topic: Encapsulation
        Question: What are the key principles behind Encapsulation? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Encapsulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving encapsulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Encapsulation
print('Example 1503')
