        Topic: Code Readability and PEP8: Testing Strategies
        Question: How do you implement Code Readability and PEP8 (Testing Strategies) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Code Readability and PEP8 is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving code readability and pep8.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Code Readability and PEP8
print('Example 978')
