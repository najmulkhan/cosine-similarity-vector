        Topic: Map and Filter: Common Mistakes
        Question: How do you implement Map and Filter (Common Mistakes) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Map and Filter is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving map and filter.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.
9. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Map and Filter
print('Example 1678')
