        Topic: Designing RESTful APIs: Hands-on Example (variant 927)
        Question: How do you implement Designing RESTful APIs (Hands-on Example) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Designing RESTful APIs is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving designing restful apis.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Designing RESTful APIs
print('Example 927')
