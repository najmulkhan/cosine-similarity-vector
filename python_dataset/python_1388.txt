        Topic: Localization (l10n): Real-world Use Case (variant 1388)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Localization (l10n) (Real-world Use Case)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Localization (l10n) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving localization (l10n).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Localization (l10n)
print('Example 1388')
