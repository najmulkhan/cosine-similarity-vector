        Topic: Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) (variant 1996)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Data Serialization (pickle, marshal)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving data serialization (pickle, marshal).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
9. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
10. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
11. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Data Serialization (pickle, marshal)
print('Example 1996')
