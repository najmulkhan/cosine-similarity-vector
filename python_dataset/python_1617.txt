        Topic: Dependency Injection Basics: Edge Cases (variant 1617)
        Question: Explain the concept of Dependency Injection Basics (Edge Cases) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Dependency Injection Basics is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving dependency injection basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Dependency Injection Basics
print('Example 1617')
