        Topic: Matplotlib Basic Plots: Performance Considerations
        Question: How do you implement Matplotlib Basic Plots (Performance Considerations) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Matplotlib Basic Plots is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving matplotlib basic plots.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Matplotlib Basic Plots
print('Example 96')
