        Topic: Recursion Basics: Performance Considerations
        Question: How do you implement Recursion Basics (Performance Considerations) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Recursion Basics is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving recursion basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n<=1 else n*factorial(n-1)
