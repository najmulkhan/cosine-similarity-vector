        Topic: Reflection and inspect: Security Considerations
        Question: Describe Reflection and inspect (Security Considerations) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Reflection and inspect is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving reflection and inspect.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Reflection and inspect
print('Example 1719')
