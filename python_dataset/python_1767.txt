        Topic: Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton): Optimization Tips
        Question: How does Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) (Optimization Tips) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving design patterns (factory, singleton).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton)
print('Example 1767')
