        Topic: Functions and Parameters: Interview Question
        Question: What are the key principles behind Functions and Parameters (Interview Question)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Functions and Parameters is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving functions and parameters.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Functions and Parameters
print('Example 1425')
