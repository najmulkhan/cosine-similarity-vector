        Topic: Contextvars: Comparison with alternatives (variant 1645)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Contextvars (Comparison with alternatives)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Contextvars is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving contextvars.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
9. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
10. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
11. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
12. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Contextvars
print('Example 1645')
