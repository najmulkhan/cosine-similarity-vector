        Topic: Control Flow: Advanced Techniques (variant 957)
        Question: How does Control Flow (Advanced Techniques) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Control Flow is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving control flow.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Control Flow
print('Example 957')
