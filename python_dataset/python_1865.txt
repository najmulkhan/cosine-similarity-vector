        Topic: String Manipulation: Common Mistakes
        Question: How do you implement String Manipulation (Common Mistakes) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        String Manipulation is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving string manipulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
9. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
10. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
11. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating String Manipulation
print('Example 1865')
