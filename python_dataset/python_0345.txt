        Topic: Internationalization (i18n): Performance Considerations
        Question: Explain the concept of Internationalization (i18n) (Performance Considerations) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Internationalization (i18n) is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving internationalization (i18n).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Internationalization (i18n)
print('Example 345')
