        Topic: Variables and Data Types: Security Considerations
        Question: How does Variables and Data Types (Security Considerations) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Variables and Data Types is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving variables and data types.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        x = 5
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
