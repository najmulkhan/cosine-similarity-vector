        Topic: Finite State Machines in Python: Best Practices
        Question: How does Finite State Machines in Python (Best Practices) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Finite State Machines in Python is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving finite state machines in python.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Finite State Machines in Python
print('Example 1017')
