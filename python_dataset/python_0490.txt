        Topic: Searching Algorithms (Binary Search): Conceptual Overview
        Question: What are the key principles behind Searching Algorithms (Binary Search) (Conceptual Overview)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Searching Algorithms (Binary Search) is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving searching algorithms (binary search).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Searching Algorithms (Binary Search)
print('Example 490')
