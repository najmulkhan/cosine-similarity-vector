        Topic: Inheritance and Polymorphism: Security Considerations (variant 1598)
        Question: How do you implement Inheritance and Polymorphism (Security Considerations) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Inheritance and Polymorphism is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving inheritance and polymorphism.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Inheritance and Polymorphism
print('Example 1598')
