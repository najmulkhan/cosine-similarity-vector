        Topic: Logging Best Practices: Short Tutorial (variant 1604)
        Question: Explain the concept of Logging Best Practices (Short Tutorial) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Logging Best Practices is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving logging best practices.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
9. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
10. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
11. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Logging Best Practices
print('Example 1604')
