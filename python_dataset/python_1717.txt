        Topic: Algorithm Complexity (Big-O): Best Practices (variant 1717)
        Question: Describe Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) (Best Practices) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving algorithm complexity (big-o).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Algorithm Complexity (Big-O)
print('Example 1717')
