        Topic: If Statements: Cheat Sheet
        Question: How does If Statements (Cheat Sheet) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        If Statements is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving if statements.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating If Statements
print('Example 900')
