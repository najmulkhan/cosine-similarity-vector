        Topic: Metaclasses (Intro): Step-by-Step
        Question: How does Metaclasses (Intro) (Step-by-Step) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Metaclasses (Intro) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving metaclasses (intro).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Metaclasses (Intro)
print('Example 939')
