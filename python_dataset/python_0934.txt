        Topic: Variable Scope: Security Considerations
        Question: How does Variable Scope (Security Considerations) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Variable Scope is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving variable scope.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Variable Scope
print('Example 934')
