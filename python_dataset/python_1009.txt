        Topic: Control Flow (variant 1009)
        Question: Describe Control Flow and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Control Flow is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving control flow.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
