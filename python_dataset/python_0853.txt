        Topic: Lambda Functions: Testing Strategies
        Question: How do you implement Lambda Functions (Testing Strategies) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Lambda Functions is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving lambda functions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Lambda Functions
print('Example 853')
