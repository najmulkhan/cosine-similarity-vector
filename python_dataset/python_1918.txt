        Topic: State Machines: Testing Strategies
        Question: What are the key principles behind State Machines (Testing Strategies)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        State Machines is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving state machines.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating State Machines
print('Example 1918')
