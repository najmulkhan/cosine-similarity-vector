        Topic: If Statements: Beginner Guide
        Question: How does If Statements (Beginner Guide) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        If Statements is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving if statements.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating If Statements
print('Example 954')
