        Topic: Typing and Type Hints: In-depth Explanation
        Question: Explain the concept of Typing and Type Hints (In-depth Explanation) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Typing and Type Hints is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving typing and type hints.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
9. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
10. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
11. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Typing and Type Hints
print('Example 1962')
