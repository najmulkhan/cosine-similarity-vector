        Topic: Error Handling and Exceptions: Performance Considerations
        Question: Explain the concept of Error Handling and Exceptions (Performance Considerations) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Error Handling and Exceptions is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving error handling and exceptions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Error Handling and Exceptions
print('Example 1257')
