        Topic: Timezone Handling: Testing Strategies
        Question: Explain the concept of Timezone Handling (Testing Strategies) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Timezone Handling is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving timezone handling.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Timezone Handling
print('Example 883')
