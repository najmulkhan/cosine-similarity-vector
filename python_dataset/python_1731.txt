        Topic: NumPy Arrays Basics: Interview Question
        Question: Describe NumPy Arrays Basics (Interview Question) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        NumPy Arrays Basics is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving numpy arrays basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
9. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
10. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
11. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1,2,3])
