        Topic: Data Serialization (pickle, marshal): Implementation Walkthrough (variant 1171)
        Question: How does Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) (Implementation Walkthrough) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving data serialization (pickle, marshal).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Data Serialization (pickle, marshal)
print('Example 1171')
