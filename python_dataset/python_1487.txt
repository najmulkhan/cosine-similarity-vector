        Topic: Concurrency vs Parallelism: Real-world Use Case (variant 1487)
        Question: Describe Concurrency vs Parallelism (Real-world Use Case) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Concurrency vs Parallelism is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving concurrency vs parallelism.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Concurrency vs Parallelism
print('Example 1487')
