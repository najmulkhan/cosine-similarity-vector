        Topic: Inheritance and Polymorphism: Beginner Guide
        Question: How do you implement Inheritance and Polymorphism (Beginner Guide) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Inheritance and Polymorphism is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving inheritance and polymorphism.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.
9. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
10. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Inheritance and Polymorphism
print('Example 1856')
