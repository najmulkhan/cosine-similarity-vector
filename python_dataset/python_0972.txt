        Topic: Classes and Objects: Short Tutorial
        Question: How does Classes and Objects (Short Tutorial) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Classes and Objects is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving classes and objects.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Classes and Objects
print('Example 972')
