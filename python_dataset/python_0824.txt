        Topic: Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) (variant 824)
        Question: How do you implement Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving algorithm complexity (big-o).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Algorithm Complexity (Big-O)
print('Example 824')
