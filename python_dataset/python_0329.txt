        Topic: For Loops: Best Practices
        Question: How do you implement For Loops (Best Practices) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        For Loops is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving for loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
