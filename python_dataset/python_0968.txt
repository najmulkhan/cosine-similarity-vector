        Topic: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics: Cheat Sheet
        Question: How does Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics (Cheat Sheet) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving object-oriented programming (oop) basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics
print('Example 968')
