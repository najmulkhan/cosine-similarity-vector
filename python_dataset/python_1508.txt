        Topic: Function Decorators: Step-by-Step (variant 1508)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Function Decorators (Step-by-Step)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Function Decorators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving function decorators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Function Decorators
print('Example 1508')
