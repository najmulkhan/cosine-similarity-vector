        Topic: Searching Algorithms (Binary Search): Interview Question
        Question: How do you implement Searching Algorithms (Binary Search) (Interview Question) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Searching Algorithms (Binary Search) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving searching algorithms (binary search).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Searching Algorithms (Binary Search)
print('Example 931')
