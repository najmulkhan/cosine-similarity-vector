        Topic: Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton): In-depth Explanation
        Question: What are the key principles behind Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) (In-depth Explanation)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving design patterns (factory, singleton).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton)
print('Example 1075')
