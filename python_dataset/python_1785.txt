        Topic: Metaclasses (Intro): Performance Considerations
        Question: Explain the concept of Metaclasses (Intro) (Performance Considerations) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Metaclasses (Intro) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving metaclasses (intro).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
9. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
10. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
11. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Metaclasses (Intro)
print('Example 1785')
