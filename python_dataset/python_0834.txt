        Topic: Generators: Cheat Sheet
        Question: Describe Generators (Cheat Sheet) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Generators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Generators
print('Example 834')
