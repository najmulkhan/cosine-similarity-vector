        Topic: Control Flow: Conceptual Overview
        Question: How does Control Flow (Conceptual Overview) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Control Flow is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving control flow.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Control Flow
print('Example 894')
