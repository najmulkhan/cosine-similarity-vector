        Topic: Dependency Injection Basics: Interview Question (variant 1654)
        Question: How do you implement Dependency Injection Basics (Interview Question) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Dependency Injection Basics is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving dependency injection basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.
9. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Dependency Injection Basics
print('Example 1654')
