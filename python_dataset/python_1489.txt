        Topic: Environment Variables: Beginner Guide
        Question: Describe Environment Variables (Beginner Guide) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Environment Variables is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving environment variables.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Environment Variables
print('Example 1489')
