        Topic: Encapsulation: Cheat Sheet (variant 1385)
        Question: How do you implement Encapsulation (Cheat Sheet) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Encapsulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving encapsulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Encapsulation
print('Example 1385')
