        Topic: Variable Scope: Hands-on Example
        Question: Explain the concept of Variable Scope (Hands-on Example) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Variable Scope is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving variable scope.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Variable Scope
print('Example 1338')
