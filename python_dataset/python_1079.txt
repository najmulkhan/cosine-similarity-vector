        Topic: Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) (variant 1079)
        Question: Describe Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving data serialization (pickle, marshal).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Data Serialization (pickle, marshal)
print('Example 1079')
