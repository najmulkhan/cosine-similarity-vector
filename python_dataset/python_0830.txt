        Topic: Regular Expressions: Step-by-Step (variant 830)
        Question: Describe Regular Expressions (Step-by-Step) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Regular Expressions is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving regular expressions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Regular Expressions
print('Example 830')
