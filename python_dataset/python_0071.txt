        Topic: While Loops: Practical Example
        Question: How do you implement While Loops (Practical Example) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        While Loops is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving while loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating While Loops
print('Example 71')
