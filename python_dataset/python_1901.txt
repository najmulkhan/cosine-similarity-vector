        Topic: Variables and Data Types: Interview Question (variant 1901)
        Question: How do you implement Variables and Data Types (Interview Question) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Variables and Data Types is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving variables and data types.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
9. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
10. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
11. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        x = 5
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
