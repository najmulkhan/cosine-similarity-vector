        Topic: List Comprehensions: Practical Example
        Question: How does List Comprehensions (Practical Example) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        List Comprehensions is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving list comprehensions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        [x*x for x in range(5)]  # [0,1,4,9,16]
