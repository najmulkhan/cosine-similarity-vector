        Question: How does For Loops (In-depth Explanation) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        For Loops is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving for loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        for i in range(3):
    print(i)
