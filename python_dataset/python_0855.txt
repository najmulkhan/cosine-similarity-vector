        Topic: Map and Filter: Implementation Walkthrough (variant 855)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Map and Filter (Implementation Walkthrough)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Map and Filter is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving map and filter.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Map and Filter
print('Example 855')
