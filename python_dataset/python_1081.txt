        Topic: Data Serialization (pickle, marshal): Testing Strategies
        Question: How do you implement Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) (Testing Strategies) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving data serialization (pickle, marshal).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Data Serialization (pickle, marshal)
print('Example 1081')
