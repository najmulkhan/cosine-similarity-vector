        Topic: Recursion Advanced: Performance Considerations (variant 1660)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Recursion Advanced (Performance Considerations)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Recursion Advanced is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving recursion advanced.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
9. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
10. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Recursion Advanced
print('Example 1660')
