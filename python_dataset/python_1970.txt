        Topic: String Manipulation (variant 1970)
        Question: Describe String Manipulation and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        String Manipulation is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving string manipulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating String Manipulation
print('Example 1970')
