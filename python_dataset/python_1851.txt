        Topic: Caching Strategies (lru_cache): Conceptual Overview (variant 1851)
        Question: How do you implement Caching Strategies (lru_cache) (Conceptual Overview) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Caching Strategies (lru_cache) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving caching strategies (lru_cache).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.
9. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
10. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
11. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Caching Strategies (lru_cache)
print('Example 1851')
