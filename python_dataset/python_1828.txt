        Topic: Rate Limiting: Practical Example
        Question: What are the key principles behind Rate Limiting (Practical Example)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Rate Limiting is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving rate limiting.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Rate Limiting
print('Example 1828')
