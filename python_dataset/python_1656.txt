        Topic: State Machines: Edge Cases
        Question: How does State Machines (Edge Cases) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        State Machines is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving state machines.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating State Machines
print('Example 1656')
