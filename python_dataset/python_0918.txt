        Topic: Regular Expressions: Edge Cases
        Question: Describe Regular Expressions (Edge Cases) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Regular Expressions is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving regular expressions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Regular Expressions
print('Example 918')
