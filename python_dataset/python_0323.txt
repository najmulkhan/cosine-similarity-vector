        Topic: Iterators: Step-by-Step
        Question: Describe Iterators (Step-by-Step) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Iterators is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving iterators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Iterators
print('Example 323')
