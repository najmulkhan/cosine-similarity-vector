        Topic: Magic Methods (__init__, __str__): Edge Cases
        Question: How do you implement Magic Methods (__init__, __str__) (Edge Cases) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Magic Methods (__init__, __str__) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving magic methods (__init__, __str__).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Magic Methods (__init__, __str__)
print('Example 1153')
