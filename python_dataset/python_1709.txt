        Topic: Parsing Command Output: Testing Strategies (variant 1709)
        Question: Describe Parsing Command Output (Testing Strategies) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Parsing Command Output is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving parsing command output.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
9. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
10. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
11. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
12. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Parsing Command Output
