        Topic: Backoff and Retry Patterns: Common Mistakes
        Question: Describe Backoff and Retry Patterns (Common Mistakes) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Backoff and Retry Patterns is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving backoff and retry patterns.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Backoff and Retry Patterns
print('Example 1448')
