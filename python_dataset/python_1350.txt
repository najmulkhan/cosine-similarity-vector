        Topic: Localization (l10n): Testing Strategies
        Question: How does Localization (l10n) (Testing Strategies) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Localization (l10n) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving localization (l10n).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Localization (l10n)
print('Example 1350')
