        Topic: Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort): In-depth Explanation (variant 1615)
        Question: Explain the concept of Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) (In-depth Explanation) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort)
print('Example 1615')
