        Topic: Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton)
        Question: How do you implement Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving design patterns (factory, singleton).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
9. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton)
print('Example 1817')
