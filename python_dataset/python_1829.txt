        Topic: Unit Testing with unittest: Edge Cases
        Question: How does Unit Testing with unittest (Edge Cases) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Unit Testing with unittest is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving unit testing with unittest.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Unit Testing with unittest
print('Example 1829')
