        Topic: If Statements: In-depth Explanation
        Question: Explain the concept of If Statements (In-depth Explanation) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        If Statements is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving if statements.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating If Statements
print('Example 1418')
