        Topic: Decorators Basics: Real-world Use Case
        Question: Describe Decorators Basics (Real-world Use Case) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Decorators Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving decorators basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        def deco(f):
    def wrapper():
        print('before')
        f()
    return wrapper
