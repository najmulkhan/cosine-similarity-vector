        Topic: Decorators Basics: In-depth Explanation
        Question: Explain the concept of Decorators Basics (In-depth Explanation) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Decorators Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving decorators basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        def deco(f):
    def wrapper():
        print('before')
        f()
    return wrapper
