        Topic: Dockerizing Python Apps: Cheat Sheet (variant 1685)
        Question: How do you implement Dockerizing Python Apps (Cheat Sheet) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Dockerizing Python Apps is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving dockerizing python apps.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.
9. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
10. Add tests to verify correctness.
11. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
12. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Dockerizing Python Apps
print('Example 1685')
