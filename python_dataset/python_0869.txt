        Topic: Regular Expressions: Conceptual Overview
        Question: How do you implement Regular Expressions (Conceptual Overview) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Regular Expressions is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving regular expressions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Regular Expressions
print('Example 869')
