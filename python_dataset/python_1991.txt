        Topic: Encapsulation: Security Considerations (variant 1991)
        Question: Describe Encapsulation (Security Considerations) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Encapsulation is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving encapsulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Encapsulation
print('Example 1991')
