        Topic: Performance Profiling: Optimization Tips
        Question: What are the key principles behind Performance Profiling (Optimization Tips)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Performance Profiling is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving performance profiling.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Performance Profiling
print('Example 684')
