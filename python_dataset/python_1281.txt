        Topic: While Loops: Cheat Sheet
        Question: Explain the concept of While Loops (Cheat Sheet) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        While Loops is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving while loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating While Loops
print('Example 1281')
