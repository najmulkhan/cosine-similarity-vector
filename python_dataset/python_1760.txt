        Topic: Configuration Management: Practical Example
        Question: How does Configuration Management (Practical Example) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Configuration Management is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving configuration management.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
9. Add tests to verify correctness.
10. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
11. Add tests to verify correctness.
12. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Configuration Management
print('Example 1760')
