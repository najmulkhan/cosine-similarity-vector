        Topic: List Comprehensions: Performance Considerations (variant 1457)
        Question: How do you implement List Comprehensions (Performance Considerations) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        List Comprehensions is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving list comprehensions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        [x*x for x in range(5)]  # [0,1,4,9,16]
