        Topic: String Manipulation (variant 1415)
        Question: How does String Manipulation work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        String Manipulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving string manipulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating String Manipulation
print('Example 1415')
