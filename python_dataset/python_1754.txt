        Topic: Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton): Conceptual Overview
        Question: How does Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) (Conceptual Overview) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving design patterns (factory, singleton).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
9. Document assumptions and usage examples.
10. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton)
print('Example 1754')
