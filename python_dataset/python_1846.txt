        Topic: Regular Expressions: Beginner Guide
        Question: How does Regular Expressions (Beginner Guide) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Regular Expressions is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving regular expressions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
9. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
10. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Regular Expressions
print('Example 1846')
