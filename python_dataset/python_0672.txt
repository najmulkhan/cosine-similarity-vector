        Topic: State Machines: Cheat Sheet (variant 672)
        Question: How does State Machines (Cheat Sheet) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        State Machines is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving state machines.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating State Machines
print('Example 672')
