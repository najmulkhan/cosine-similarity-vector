        Topic: Greedy Algorithms (variant 1589)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Greedy Algorithms? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Greedy Algorithms is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving greedy algorithms.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Greedy Algorithms
print('Example 1589')
