        Topic: Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton): Interview Question
        Question: How does Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) (Interview Question) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving design patterns (factory, singleton).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton)
print('Example 1424')
