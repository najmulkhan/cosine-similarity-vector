        Topic: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics: Cheat Sheet (variant 1289)
        Question: How do you implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics (Cheat Sheet) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving object-oriented programming (oop) basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics
print('Example 1289')
