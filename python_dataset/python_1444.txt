        Topic: Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort): Cheat Sheet
        Question: How does Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) (Cheat Sheet) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort)
print('Example 1444')
