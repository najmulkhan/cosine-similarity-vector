        Topic: String Manipulation: Short Tutorial (variant 1538)
        Question: How do you implement String Manipulation (Short Tutorial) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        String Manipulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving string manipulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating String Manipulation
print('Example 1538')
