        Topic: File I/O: Edge Cases (variant 935)
        Question: Describe File I/O (Edge Cases) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        File I/O is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving file i/o.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        with open('data.txt') as f:
    text = f.read()
