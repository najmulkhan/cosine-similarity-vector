        Topic: Exponential Backoff: Advanced Techniques
        Question: Explain the concept of Exponential Backoff (Advanced Techniques) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Exponential Backoff is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving exponential backoff.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Exponential Backoff
print('Example 1302')
