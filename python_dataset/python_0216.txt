        Topic: Algorithm Complexity (Big-O): Short Tutorial (variant 216)
        Question: Describe Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) (Short Tutorial) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving algorithm complexity (big-o).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Algorithm Complexity (Big-O)
print('Example 216')
