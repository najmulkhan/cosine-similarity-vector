        Topic: NumPy Broadcasting: Edge Cases
        Question: Describe NumPy Broadcasting (Edge Cases) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        NumPy Broadcasting is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving numpy broadcasting.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating NumPy Broadcasting
print('Example 25')
