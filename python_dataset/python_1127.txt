        Question: Explain the concept of Generators (Interview Question) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Generators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
