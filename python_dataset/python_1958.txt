        Topic: Iterators: Hands-on Example
        Question: How do you implement Iterators (Hands-on Example) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Iterators is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving iterators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Iterators
print('Example 1958')
