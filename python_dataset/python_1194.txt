        Topic: Operators: Short Tutorial
        Question: What are the key principles behind Operators (Short Tutorial)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Operators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving operators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Operators
print('Example 1194')
