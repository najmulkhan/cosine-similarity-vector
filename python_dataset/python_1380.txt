        Topic: Garbage Collection: Comparison with alternatives
        Question: Explain the concept of Garbage Collection (Comparison with alternatives) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Garbage Collection is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving garbage collection.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Garbage Collection
print('Example 1380')
