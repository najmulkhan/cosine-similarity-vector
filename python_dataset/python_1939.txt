        Topic: Finite State Machines in Python: Step-by-Step
        Question: Explain the concept of Finite State Machines in Python (Step-by-Step) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Finite State Machines in Python is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving finite state machines in python.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
9. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
10. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Finite State Machines in Python
print('Example 1939')
