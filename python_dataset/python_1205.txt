        Topic: Recursion Basics: Advanced Techniques (variant 1205)
        Question: Explain the concept of Recursion Basics (Advanced Techniques) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Recursion Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving recursion basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n<=1 else n*factorial(n-1)
