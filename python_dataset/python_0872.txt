        Topic: For Loops: Step-by-Step (variant 872)
        Question: Describe For Loops (Step-by-Step) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        For Loops is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving for loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        for i in range(3):
    print(i)
