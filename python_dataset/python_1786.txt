        Topic: Contextvars (variant 1786)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Contextvars? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Contextvars is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving contextvars.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
9. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
10. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Contextvars
print('Example 1786')
