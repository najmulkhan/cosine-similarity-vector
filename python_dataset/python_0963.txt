        Topic: Backoff and Retry Patterns: Beginner Guide
        Question: How do you implement Backoff and Retry Patterns (Beginner Guide) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Backoff and Retry Patterns is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving backoff and retry patterns.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Backoff and Retry Patterns
print('Example 963')
