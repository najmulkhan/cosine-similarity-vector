        Topic: Testing with pytest
        Question: How do you implement Testing with pytest in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Testing with pytest is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving testing with pytest.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Testing with pytest
