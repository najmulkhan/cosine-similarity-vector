        Topic: Refactoring Techniques: Conceptual Overview (variant 1068)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Refactoring Techniques (Conceptual Overview)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Refactoring Techniques is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving refactoring techniques.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Refactoring Techniques
print('Example 1068')
