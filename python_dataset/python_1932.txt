        Topic: State Machines: Short Tutorial
        Question: What are the key principles behind State Machines (Short Tutorial)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        State Machines is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving state machines.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
9. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating State Machines
print('Example 1932')
