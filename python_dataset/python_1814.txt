        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.
