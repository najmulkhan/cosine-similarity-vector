        Topic: Backoff and Retry Patterns: Edge Cases
        Question: What are the key principles behind Backoff and Retry Patterns (Edge Cases)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Backoff and Retry Patterns is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving backoff and retry patterns.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Backoff and Retry Patterns
print('Example 1533')
