        Topic: Generators (variant 1288)
        Question: How do you implement Generators in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Generators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Generators
print('Example 1288')
