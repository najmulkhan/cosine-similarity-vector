        Topic: Function Decorators: Common Mistakes (variant 1556)
        Question: How do you implement Function Decorators (Common Mistakes) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Function Decorators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving function decorators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Function Decorators
print('Example 1556')
