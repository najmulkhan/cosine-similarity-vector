        Topic: Algorithm Complexity (Big-O): Step-by-Step
        Question: What are the key principles behind Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) (Step-by-Step)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving algorithm complexity (big-o).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Algorithm Complexity (Big-O)
print('Example 928')
