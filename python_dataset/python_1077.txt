        Question: How do you implement Refactoring Techniques (Best Practices) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Refactoring Techniques is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving refactoring techniques.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
