        Topic: Asyncio Basics: Performance Considerations
        Question: Explain the concept of Asyncio Basics (Performance Considerations) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Asyncio Basics is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving asyncio basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        import asyncio
async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
