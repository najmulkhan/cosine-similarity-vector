        Topic: String Manipulation: Implementation Walkthrough
        Question: How do you implement String Manipulation (Implementation Walkthrough) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        String Manipulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving string manipulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating String Manipulation
print('Example 1430')
