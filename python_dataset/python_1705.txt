        Topic: If Statements: Step-by-Step
        Question: What are the key principles behind If Statements (Step-by-Step)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        If Statements is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving if statements.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
9. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
10. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating If Statements
print('Example 1705')
