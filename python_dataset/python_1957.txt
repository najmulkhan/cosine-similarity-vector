        Topic: Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton): In-depth Explanation (variant 1957)
        Question: How do you implement Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) (In-depth Explanation) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving design patterns (factory, singleton).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
9. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
10. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
11. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
12. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton)
print('Example 1957')
