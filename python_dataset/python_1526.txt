        Topic: Dependency Injection Basics: Interview Question
        Question: How does Dependency Injection Basics (Interview Question) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Dependency Injection Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving dependency injection basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Dependency Injection Basics
print('Example 1526')
