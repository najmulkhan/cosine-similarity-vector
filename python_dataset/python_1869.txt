        Topic: APIs and JSON: Optimization Tips (variant 1869)
        Question: How do you implement APIs and JSON (Optimization Tips) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        APIs and JSON is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving apis and json.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating APIs and JSON
print('Example 1869')
