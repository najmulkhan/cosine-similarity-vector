        Topic: Pandas Data Manipulation: Hands-on Example
        Question: What are the key principles behind Pandas Data Manipulation (Hands-on Example)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Pandas Data Manipulation is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving pandas data manipulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.
9. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
10. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
11. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Pandas Data Manipulation
print('Example 1936')
