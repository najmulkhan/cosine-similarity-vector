        Topic: Regular Expressions: Edge Cases (variant 1852)
        Question: Explain the concept of Regular Expressions (Edge Cases) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Regular Expressions is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving regular expressions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
9. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
10. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
11. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Regular Expressions
print('Example 1852')
