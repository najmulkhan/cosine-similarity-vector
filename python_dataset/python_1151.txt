        Topic: Virtual Environments
        Question: Describe Virtual Environments and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Virtual Environments is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving virtual environments.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
