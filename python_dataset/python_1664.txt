        Topic: Threading Basics: Hands-on Example (variant 1664)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Threading Basics (Hands-on Example)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Threading Basics is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving threading basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Threading Basics
print('Example 1664')
