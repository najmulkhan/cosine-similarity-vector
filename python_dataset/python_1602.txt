        Topic: Interacting with OS (os, subprocess) (variant 1602)
        Question: How do you implement Interacting with OS (os, subprocess) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Interacting with OS (os, subprocess) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving interacting with os (os, subprocess).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
9. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
10. Add tests to verify correctness.
11. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Interacting with OS (os, subprocess)
print('Example 1602')
