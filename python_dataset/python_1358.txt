        Question: How do you implement If Statements (Hands-on Example) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        If Statements is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving if statements.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
