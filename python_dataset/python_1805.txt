        Topic: Parsing Command Output (variant 1805)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Parsing Command Output? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Parsing Command Output is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving parsing command output.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
9. Document assumptions and usage examples.
10. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Parsing Command Output
print('Example 1805')
