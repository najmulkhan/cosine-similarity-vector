        Topic: Stacks and Queues: Testing Strategies
        Question: How does Stacks and Queues (Testing Strategies) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Stacks and Queues is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving stacks and queues.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Stacks and Queues
print('Example 1312')
