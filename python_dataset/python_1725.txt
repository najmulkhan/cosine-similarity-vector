        Topic: Date and Time (datetime, pytz): Testing Strategies
        Question: What are the key principles behind Date and Time (datetime, pytz) (Testing Strategies)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Date and Time (datetime, pytz) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving date and time (datetime, pytz).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
9. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
10. Document assumptions and usage examples.
11. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
12. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Date and Time (datetime, pytz)
print('Example 1725')
