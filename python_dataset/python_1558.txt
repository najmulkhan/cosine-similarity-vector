        Topic: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics: Real-world Use Case
        Question: Describe Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics (Real-world Use Case) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving object-oriented programming (oop) basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics
print('Example 1558')
