        Topic: Decorators Basics: Implementation Walkthrough
        Question: Explain the concept of Decorators Basics (Implementation Walkthrough) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Decorators Basics is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving decorators basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.
9. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
10. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        def deco(f):
    def wrapper():
        print('before')
        f()
    return wrapper
