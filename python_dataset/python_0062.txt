        Topic: Generators: Comparison with alternatives
        Question: How do you implement Generators (Comparison with alternatives) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Generators is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Generators
print('Example 62')
