        Topic: Metaclasses (Intro) (variant 1621)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Metaclasses (Intro)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Metaclasses (Intro) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving metaclasses (intro).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
9. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Metaclasses (Intro)
print('Example 1621')
