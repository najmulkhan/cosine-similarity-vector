        Topic: Variable Scope: Optimization Tips
        Question: How does Variable Scope (Optimization Tips) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Variable Scope is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving variable scope.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Variable Scope
print('Example 1567')
