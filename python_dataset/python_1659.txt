        Topic: Function Decorators: Common Mistakes (variant 1659)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Function Decorators (Common Mistakes)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Function Decorators is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving function decorators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
9. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
10. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Function Decorators
print('Example 1659')
