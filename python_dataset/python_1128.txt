        Question: How do you implement Decorators Basics (Performance Considerations) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Decorators Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving decorators basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        def deco(f):
    def wrapper():
        print('before')
        f()
    return wrapper
