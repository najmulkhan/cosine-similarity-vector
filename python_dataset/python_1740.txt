        Topic: Meta-programming: Interview Question (variant 1740)
        Question: How does Meta-programming (Interview Question) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Meta-programming is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving meta-programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Meta-programming
print('Example 1740')
