        Question: How do you implement NumPy Arrays Basics (Optimization Tips) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        NumPy Arrays Basics is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving numpy arrays basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1,2,3])
