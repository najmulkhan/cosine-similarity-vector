        Topic: Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort)
        Question: How do you implement Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort)
print('Example 1200')
