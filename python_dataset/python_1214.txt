        Topic: Encapsulation: Practical Example (variant 1214)
        Question: How does Encapsulation (Practical Example) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Encapsulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving encapsulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
