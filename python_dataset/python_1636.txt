        Topic: For Loops: Short Tutorial
        Question: What are the key principles behind For Loops (Short Tutorial)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        For Loops is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving for loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
9. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
10. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
11. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        for i in range(3):
    print(i)
