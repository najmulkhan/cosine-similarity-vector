        Topic: Inheritance and Polymorphism: Step-by-Step
        Question: How do you implement Inheritance and Polymorphism (Step-by-Step) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Inheritance and Polymorphism is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving inheritance and polymorphism.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Inheritance and Polymorphism
print('Example 816')
