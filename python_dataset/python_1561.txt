        Topic: NumPy Arrays Basics: Conceptual Overview
        Question: What are the key principles behind NumPy Arrays Basics (Conceptual Overview)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        NumPy Arrays Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving numpy arrays basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1,2,3])
