        Topic: Dockerizing Python Apps: Comparison with alternatives (variant 1286)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Dockerizing Python Apps (Comparison with alternatives)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Dockerizing Python Apps is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving dockerizing python apps.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Dockerizing Python Apps
print('Example 1286')
