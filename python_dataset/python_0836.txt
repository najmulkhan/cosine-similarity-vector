        Topic: Meta-programming: Optimization Tips (variant 836)
        Question: Describe Meta-programming (Optimization Tips) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Meta-programming is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving meta-programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Meta-programming
print('Example 836')
