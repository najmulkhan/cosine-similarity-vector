        Topic: Asyncio Basics (variant 1554)
        Question: How does Asyncio Basics work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Asyncio Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving asyncio basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        import asyncio
async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
