        Topic: Caching Strategies (lru_cache): Testing Strategies
        Question: What are the key principles behind Caching Strategies (lru_cache) (Testing Strategies)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Caching Strategies (lru_cache) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving caching strategies (lru_cache).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Caching Strategies (lru_cache)
print('Example 1623')
