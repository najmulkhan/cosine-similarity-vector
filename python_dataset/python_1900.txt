        Topic: Sockets Programming: Hands-on Example
        Question: How do you implement Sockets Programming (Hands-on Example) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Sockets Programming is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving sockets programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
9. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
10. Document assumptions and usage examples.
11. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',9000))
