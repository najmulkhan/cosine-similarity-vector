        Topic: Default Arguments: Optimization Tips
        Question: How do you implement Default Arguments (Optimization Tips) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Default Arguments is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving default arguments.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Default Arguments
print('Example 817')
