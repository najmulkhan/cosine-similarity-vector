        Topic: Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort): Real-world Use Case
        Question: How does Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) (Real-world Use Case) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
9. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort)
print('Example 1820')
