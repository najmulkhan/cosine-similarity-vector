        Topic: Regular Expressions: Step-by-Step
        Question: How does Regular Expressions (Step-by-Step) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Regular Expressions is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving regular expressions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Regular Expressions
print('Example 669')
