        Topic: Asyncio Basics: Comparison with alternatives
        Question: Explain the concept of Asyncio Basics (Comparison with alternatives) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Asyncio Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving asyncio basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        import asyncio
async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
