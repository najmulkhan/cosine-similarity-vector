        Topic: Timezone Handling: Edge Cases
        Question: How do you implement Timezone Handling (Edge Cases) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Timezone Handling is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving timezone handling.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Timezone Handling
print('Example 917')
