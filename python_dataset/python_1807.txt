        Topic: Magic Methods (__init__, __str__): Edge Cases (variant 1807)
        Question: How does Magic Methods (__init__, __str__) (Edge Cases) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Magic Methods (__init__, __str__) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving magic methods (__init__, __str__).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
9. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Magic Methods (__init__, __str__)
print('Example 1807')
