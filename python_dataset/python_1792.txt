        Topic: Finite State Machines in Python: Interview Question
        Question: How do you implement Finite State Machines in Python (Interview Question) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Finite State Machines in Python is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving finite state machines in python.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Finite State Machines in Python
print('Example 1792')
