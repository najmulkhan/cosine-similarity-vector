        Topic: Refactoring Techniques: Security Considerations (variant 1765)
        Question: Describe Refactoring Techniques (Security Considerations) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Refactoring Techniques is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving refactoring techniques.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
