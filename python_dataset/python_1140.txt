        Topic: Regular Expressions: Hands-on Example
        Question: How does Regular Expressions (Hands-on Example) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Regular Expressions is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving regular expressions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Regular Expressions
print('Example 1140')
