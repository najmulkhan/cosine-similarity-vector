        Topic: Debugging Techniques: Common Mistakes
        Question: What are the key principles behind Debugging Techniques (Common Mistakes)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Debugging Techniques is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving debugging techniques.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Debugging Techniques
print('Example 1256')
