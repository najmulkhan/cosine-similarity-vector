        Topic: Sockets Programming: Beginner Guide
        Question: Describe Sockets Programming (Beginner Guide) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Sockets Programming is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving sockets programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',9000))
