        Topic: Algorithm Complexity (Big-O): Best Practices
        Question: How do you implement Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) (Best Practices) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Algorithm Complexity (Big-O) is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving algorithm complexity (big-o).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Algorithm Complexity (Big-O)
print('Example 559')
