        Topic: String Manipulation: Practical Example
        Question: Explain the concept of String Manipulation (Practical Example) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        String Manipulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving string manipulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating String Manipulation
print('Example 1366')
