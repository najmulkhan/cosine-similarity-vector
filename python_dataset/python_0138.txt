        Topic: Sockets Programming: Real-world Use Case
        Question: Describe Sockets Programming (Real-world Use Case) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Sockets Programming is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving sockets programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',9000))
