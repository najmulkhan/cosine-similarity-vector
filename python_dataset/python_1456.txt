        Topic: Circuit Breaker Patterns: Performance Considerations
        Question: Describe Circuit Breaker Patterns (Performance Considerations) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Circuit Breaker Patterns is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving circuit breaker patterns.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Circuit Breaker Patterns
print('Example 1456')
