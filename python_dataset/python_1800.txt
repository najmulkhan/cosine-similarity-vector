        Topic: Graphs Basics: Interview Question (variant 1800)
        Question: Describe Graphs Basics (Interview Question) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Graphs Basics is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving graphs basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.
9. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
10. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Graphs Basics
print('Example 1800')
