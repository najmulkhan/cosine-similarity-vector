        Topic: Logging Best Practices: Hands-on Example
        Question: How do you implement Logging Best Practices (Hands-on Example) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Logging Best Practices is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving logging best practices.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
9. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
10. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
11. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
12. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Logging Best Practices
print('Example 1763')
