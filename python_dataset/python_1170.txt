        Topic: Iterators (variant 1170)
        Question: How does Iterators work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Iterators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving iterators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Iterators
print('Example 1170')
