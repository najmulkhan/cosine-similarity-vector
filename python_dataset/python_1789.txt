        Topic: Internationalization (i18n): Cheat Sheet
        Question: How does Internationalization (i18n) (Cheat Sheet) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Internationalization (i18n) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving internationalization (i18n).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Internationalization (i18n)
print('Example 1789')
