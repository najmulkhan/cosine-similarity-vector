        Topic: For Loops: Hands-on Example (variant 1737)
        Question: Describe For Loops (Hands-on Example) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        For Loops is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving for loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        for i in range(3):
    print(i)
