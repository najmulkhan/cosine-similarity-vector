        Topic: Unit Testing with unittest: Practical Example (variant 1145)
        Question: How do you implement Unit Testing with unittest (Practical Example) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Unit Testing with unittest is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving unit testing with unittest.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Unit Testing with unittest
print('Example 1145')
