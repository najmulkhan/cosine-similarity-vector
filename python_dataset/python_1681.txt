        Topic: Data Serialization (pickle, marshal): Comparison with alternatives
        Question: How do you implement Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) (Comparison with alternatives) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Data Serialization (pickle, marshal) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving data serialization (pickle, marshal).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
9. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Data Serialization (pickle, marshal)
print('Example 1681')
