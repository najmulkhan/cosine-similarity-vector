        Topic: State Machines: Common Mistakes
        Question: What are the key principles behind State Machines (Common Mistakes)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        State Machines is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving state machines.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating State Machines
print('Example 1154')
