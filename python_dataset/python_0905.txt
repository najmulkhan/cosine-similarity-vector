        Topic: Inheritance and Polymorphism: Common Mistakes
        Question: How does Inheritance and Polymorphism (Common Mistakes) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Inheritance and Polymorphism is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving inheritance and polymorphism.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Inheritance and Polymorphism
print('Example 905')
