        Topic: Asyncio Advanced (Tasks/Loops): Performance Considerations (variant 1454)
        Question: Describe Asyncio Advanced (Tasks/Loops) (Performance Considerations) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Asyncio Advanced (Tasks/Loops) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving asyncio advanced (tasks/loops).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Asyncio Advanced (Tasks/Loops)
print('Example 1454')
