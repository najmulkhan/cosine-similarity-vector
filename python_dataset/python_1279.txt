        Topic: Virtual Environments: Testing Strategies
        Question: Describe Virtual Environments (Testing Strategies) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Virtual Environments is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving virtual environments.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Virtual Environments
print('Example 1279')
