        Topic: Designing RESTful APIs: In-depth Explanation
        Question: What are the key principles behind Designing RESTful APIs (In-depth Explanation)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Designing RESTful APIs is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving designing restful apis.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Designing RESTful APIs
print('Example 1465')
