        Topic: Function Decorators: Real-world Use Case
        Question: How do you implement Function Decorators (Real-world Use Case) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Function Decorators is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving function decorators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
9. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Function Decorators
print('Example 1748')
