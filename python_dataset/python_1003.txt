        Topic: If Statements: Advanced Techniques
        Question: What are the key principles behind If Statements (Advanced Techniques)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        If Statements is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving if statements.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating If Statements
print('Example 1003')
