        Topic: Image Processing with PIL: Testing Strategies (variant 1310)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Image Processing with PIL (Testing Strategies)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Image Processing with PIL is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving image processing with pil.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Image Processing with PIL
print('Example 1310')
