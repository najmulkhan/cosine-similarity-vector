        Topic: Image Processing with PIL
        Question: Describe Image Processing with PIL and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Image Processing with PIL is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving image processing with pil.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
9. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Image Processing with PIL
print('Example 1680')
