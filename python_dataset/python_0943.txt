        Topic: Designing RESTful APIs: Hands-on Example (variant 943)
        Question: How do you implement Designing RESTful APIs (Hands-on Example) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Designing RESTful APIs is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving designing restful apis.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Designing RESTful APIs
print('Example 943')
