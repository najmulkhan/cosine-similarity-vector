        Topic: For Loops: Real-world Use Case
        Question: Explain the concept of For Loops (Real-world Use Case) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        For Loops is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving for loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        for i in range(3):
    print(i)
