        Topic: Multiprocessing Basics: Step-by-Step (variant 1393)
        Question: How do you implement Multiprocessing Basics (Step-by-Step) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Multiprocessing Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving multiprocessing basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Multiprocessing Basics
print('Example 1393')
