        Topic: Default Arguments: Conceptual Overview
        Question: Explain the concept of Default Arguments (Conceptual Overview) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Default Arguments is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving default arguments.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Default Arguments
print('Example 1379')
