        Topic: Garbage Collection: In-depth Explanation
        Question: How does Garbage Collection (In-depth Explanation) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Garbage Collection is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving garbage collection.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Garbage Collection
print('Example 1899')
