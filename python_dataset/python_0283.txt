        Topic: Greedy Algorithms
        Question: How do you implement Greedy Algorithms in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Greedy Algorithms is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving greedy algorithms.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Greedy Algorithms
print('Example 283')
