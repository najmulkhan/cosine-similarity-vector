        Topic: Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton): Hands-on Example
        Question: How does Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) (Hands-on Example) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving design patterns (factory, singleton).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.
9. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
10. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
11. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
12. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton)
print('Example 1648')
