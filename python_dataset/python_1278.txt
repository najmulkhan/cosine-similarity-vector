        Topic: Backoff and Retry Patterns: Interview Question
        Question: Explain the concept of Backoff and Retry Patterns (Interview Question) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Backoff and Retry Patterns is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving backoff and retry patterns.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Backoff and Retry Patterns
print('Example 1278')
