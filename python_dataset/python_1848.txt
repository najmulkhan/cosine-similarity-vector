        Question: Describe Code Formatting (black, flake8) (Short Tutorial) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Code Formatting (black, flake8) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving code formatting (black, flake8).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
9. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
10. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
