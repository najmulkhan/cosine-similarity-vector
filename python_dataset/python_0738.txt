        Topic: Designing RESTful APIs: Testing Strategies (variant 738)
        Question: What are the key principles behind Designing RESTful APIs (Testing Strategies)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Designing RESTful APIs is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving designing restful apis.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Designing RESTful APIs
print('Example 738')
