        Topic: Regular Expressions: Comparison with alternatives
        Question: How does Regular Expressions (Comparison with alternatives) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Regular Expressions is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving regular expressions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Regular Expressions
print('Example 880')
