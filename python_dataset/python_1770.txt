        Topic: While Loops: Practical Example (variant 1770)
        Question: How does While Loops (Practical Example) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        While Loops is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving while loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
8. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating While Loops
print('Example 1770')
