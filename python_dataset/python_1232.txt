        Topic: Control Flow: Cheat Sheet
        Question: Describe Control Flow (Cheat Sheet) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Control Flow is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving control flow.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Control Flow
print('Example 1232')
