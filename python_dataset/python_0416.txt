        Topic: Iterators: Advanced Techniques
        Question: Describe Iterators (Advanced Techniques) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Iterators is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving iterators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Iterators
