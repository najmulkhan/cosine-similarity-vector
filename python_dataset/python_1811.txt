        Topic: Timezone Handling: Real-world Use Case
        Question: How do you implement Timezone Handling (Real-world Use Case) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Timezone Handling is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving timezone handling.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Timezone Handling
print('Example 1811')
