        Topic: Debugging Techniques: Edge Cases (variant 1173)
        Question: Explain the concept of Debugging Techniques (Edge Cases) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Debugging Techniques is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving debugging techniques.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Debugging Techniques
print('Example 1173')
