        Topic: Async Generators: Implementation Walkthrough
        Question: What are the key principles behind Async Generators (Implementation Walkthrough)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Async Generators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving async generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Async Generators
print('Example 826')
