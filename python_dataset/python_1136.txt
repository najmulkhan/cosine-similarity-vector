        Topic: Regular Expressions: Best Practices
        Question: How do you implement Regular Expressions (Best Practices) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Regular Expressions is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving regular expressions.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
