        Topic: String Manipulation: Best Practices (variant 985)
        Question: How do you implement String Manipulation (Best Practices) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        String Manipulation is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving string manipulation.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating String Manipulation
print('Example 985')
