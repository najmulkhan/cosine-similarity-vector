        Topic: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics: Practical Example
        Question: Describe Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics (Practical Example) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving object-oriented programming (oop) basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
9. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
10. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics
print('Example 1772')
