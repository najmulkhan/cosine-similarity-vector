        Topic: Dataclasses: Hands-on Example
        Question: Describe Dataclasses (Hands-on Example) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Dataclasses is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving dataclasses.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
9. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Dataclasses
print('Example 1966')
