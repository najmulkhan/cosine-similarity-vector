        Topic: Class Decorators
        Question: Describe Class Decorators and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Class Decorators is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving class decorators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Class Decorators
print('Example 1727')
