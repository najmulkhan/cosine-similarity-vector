        Topic: Performance Profiling: Hands-on Example
        Question: How do you implement Performance Profiling (Hands-on Example) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Performance Profiling is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving performance profiling.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
9. Add tests to verify correctness.
10. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
11. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Performance Profiling
print('Example 1721')
