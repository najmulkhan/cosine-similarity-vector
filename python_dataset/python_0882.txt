        Topic: Typing and Type Hints: Conceptual Overview
        Question: Describe Typing and Type Hints (Conceptual Overview) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Typing and Type Hints is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving typing and type hints.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Typing and Type Hints
print('Example 882')
