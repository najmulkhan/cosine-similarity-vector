        Topic: Garbage Collection: Step-by-Step
        Question: What are the key principles behind Garbage Collection (Step-by-Step)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Garbage Collection is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving garbage collection.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Garbage Collection
print('Example 1459')
