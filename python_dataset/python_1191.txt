        Topic: Configuration Management: Implementation Walkthrough (variant 1191)
        Question: How do you implement Configuration Management (Implementation Walkthrough) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Configuration Management is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving configuration management.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Configuration Management
print('Example 1191')
