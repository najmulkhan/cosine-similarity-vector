        Topic: Rate Limiting: Performance Considerations
        Question: Explain the concept of Rate Limiting (Performance Considerations) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Rate Limiting is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving rate limiting.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Rate Limiting
print('Example 1197')
