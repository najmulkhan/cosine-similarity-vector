        Topic: Async Generators: Comparison with alternatives
        Question: Describe Async Generators (Comparison with alternatives) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Async Generators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving async generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Async Generators
print('Example 1325')
