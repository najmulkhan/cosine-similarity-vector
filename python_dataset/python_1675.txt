        Topic: Reflection and inspect (variant 1675)
        Question: How do you implement Reflection and inspect in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Reflection and inspect is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving reflection and inspect.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
9. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
10. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
11. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
12. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Reflection and inspect
print('Example 1675')
