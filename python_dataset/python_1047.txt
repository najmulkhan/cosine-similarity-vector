        Topic: Debugging Techniques: Optimization Tips
        Question: How do you implement Debugging Techniques (Optimization Tips) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Debugging Techniques is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving debugging techniques.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Debugging Techniques
print('Example 1047')
