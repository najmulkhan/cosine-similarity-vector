        Topic: For Loops: Practical Example
        Question: What are the key principles behind For Loops (Practical Example)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        For Loops is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving for loops.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        for i in range(3):
    print(i)
