        Topic: Image Processing with PIL: Security Considerations
        Question: Explain the concept of Image Processing with PIL (Security Considerations) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Image Processing with PIL is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving image processing with pil.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
