        Topic: Async Generators: Interview Question
        Question: What are the key principles behind Async Generators (Interview Question)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Async Generators is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving async generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Async Generators
print('Example 184')
