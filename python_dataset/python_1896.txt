        Topic: Variables and Data Types: Interview Question
        Question: How do you implement Variables and Data Types (Interview Question) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Variables and Data Types is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving variables and data types.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        x = 5
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
