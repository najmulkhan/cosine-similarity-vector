        Topic: Concurrency vs Parallelism: Performance Considerations
        Question: What are the key principles behind Concurrency vs Parallelism (Performance Considerations)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Concurrency vs Parallelism is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving concurrency vs parallelism.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Concurrency vs Parallelism
print('Example 600')
