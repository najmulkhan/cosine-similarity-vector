        Topic: Metaclasses (Intro): Step-by-Step (variant 1986)
        Question: How does Metaclasses (Intro) (Step-by-Step) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Metaclasses (Intro) is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving metaclasses (intro).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
9. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
10. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Metaclasses (Intro)
print('Example 1986')
