        Topic: Reflection and inspect (variant 1224)
        Question: How does Reflection and inspect work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Reflection and inspect is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving reflection and inspect.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Reflection and inspect
print('Example 1224')
