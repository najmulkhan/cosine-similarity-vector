        Topic: Rate Limiting: Security Considerations
        Question: Explain the concept of Rate Limiting (Security Considerations) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Rate Limiting is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving rate limiting.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Rate Limiting
print('Example 1406')
