        Topic: Garbage Collection (variant 1484)
        Question: How does Garbage Collection work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Garbage Collection is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving garbage collection.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Garbage Collection
print('Example 1484')
