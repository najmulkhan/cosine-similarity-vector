        Topic: Function Decorators: Edge Cases
        Question: Explain the concept of Function Decorators (Edge Cases) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Function Decorators is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving function decorators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Function Decorators
print('Example 1258')
