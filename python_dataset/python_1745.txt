        Topic: Virtual Environments: Optimization Tips
        Question: What are the key principles behind Virtual Environments (Optimization Tips)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Virtual Environments is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving virtual environments.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Virtual Environments
print('Example 1745')
