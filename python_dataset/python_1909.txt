        Question: Describe Class Decorators and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Class Decorators is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving class decorators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
9. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
