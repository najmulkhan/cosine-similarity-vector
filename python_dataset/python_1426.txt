        Topic: Recursion Basics: Testing Strategies (variant 1426)
        Question: How does Recursion Basics (Testing Strategies) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Recursion Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving recursion basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n<=1 else n*factorial(n-1)
