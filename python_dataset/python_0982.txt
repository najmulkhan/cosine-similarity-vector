        Topic: Designing RESTful APIs: Conceptual Overview
        Question: How do you implement Designing RESTful APIs (Conceptual Overview) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Designing RESTful APIs is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving designing restful apis.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Designing RESTful APIs
print('Example 982')
