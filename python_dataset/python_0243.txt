        Topic: Sockets Programming: Practical Example
        Question: Explain the concept of Sockets Programming (Practical Example) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Sockets Programming is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving sockets programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',9000))
