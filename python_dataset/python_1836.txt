        Topic: Image Processing with PIL: In-depth Explanation
        Question: Explain the concept of Image Processing with PIL (In-depth Explanation) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Image Processing with PIL is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving image processing with pil.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
9. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Image Processing with PIL
print('Example 1836')
