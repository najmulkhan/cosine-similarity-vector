        Topic: Refactoring Techniques: Security Considerations (variant 1639)
        Question: Explain the concept of Refactoring Techniques (Security Considerations) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Refactoring Techniques is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving refactoring techniques.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Refactoring Techniques
