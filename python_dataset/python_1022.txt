        Question: How do you implement Dependency Injection Basics (Conceptual Overview) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Dependency Injection Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving dependency injection basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Dependency Injection Basics
