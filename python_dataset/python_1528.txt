        Topic: Matplotlib Basic Plots: Best Practices
        Question: What are the key principles behind Matplotlib Basic Plots (Best Practices)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Matplotlib Basic Plots is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving matplotlib basic plots.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Matplotlib Basic Plots
print('Example 1528')
