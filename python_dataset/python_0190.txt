        Topic: Meta-programming: Testing Strategies
        Question: Describe Meta-programming (Testing Strategies) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Meta-programming is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving meta-programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Meta-programming
