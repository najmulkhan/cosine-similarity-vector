        Topic: Classes and Objects: Interview Question
        Question: Describe Classes and Objects (Interview Question) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Classes and Objects is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving classes and objects.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Classes and Objects
print('Example 1596')
