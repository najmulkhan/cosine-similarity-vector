        Topic: Sockets Programming: Best Practices (variant 737)
        Question: How do you implement Sockets Programming (Best Practices) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Sockets Programming is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving sockets programming.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
3. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
4. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
5. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.

        Example:
        import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',9000))
