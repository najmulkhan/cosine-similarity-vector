        Topic: Properties and Getters: Hands-on Example
        Question: Explain the concept of Properties and Getters (Hands-on Example) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Properties and Getters is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving properties and getters.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Document assumptions and usage examples.
7. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
8. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Properties and Getters
print('Example 1941')
