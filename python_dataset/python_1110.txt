        Topic: Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort): Common Mistakes
        Question: Explain the concept of Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) (Common Mistakes) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort)
print('Example 1110')
