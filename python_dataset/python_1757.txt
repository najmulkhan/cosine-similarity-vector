        Topic: State Machines: Real-world Use Case
        Question: How does State Machines (Real-world Use Case) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        State Machines is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving state machines.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
4. Document assumptions and usage examples.
5. Document assumptions and usage examples.
6. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
7. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating State Machines
print('Example 1757')
