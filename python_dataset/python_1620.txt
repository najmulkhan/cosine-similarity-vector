        Topic: Rate Limiting Strategies: Implementation Walkthrough
        Question: Explain the concept of Rate Limiting Strategies (Implementation Walkthrough) and how it is used in Python.

        Explanation:
        Rate Limiting Strategies is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving rate limiting strategies.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
6. Add tests to verify correctness.
7. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
8. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
9. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Rate Limiting Strategies
print('Example 1620')
