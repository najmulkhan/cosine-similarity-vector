        Topic: Async Generators: Best Practices
        Question: How does Async Generators (Best Practices) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Async Generators is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving async generators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
2. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
3. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Async Generators
print('Example 655')
