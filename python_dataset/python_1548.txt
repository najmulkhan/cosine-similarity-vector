        Question: What are the key principles behind Code Readability and PEP8? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Code Readability and PEP8 is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving code readability and pep8.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Add tests to verify correctness.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
6. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Code Readability and PEP8
print('Example 1548')
