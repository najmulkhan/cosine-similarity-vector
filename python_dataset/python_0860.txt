        Topic: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics (variant 860)
        Question: Describe Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving object-oriented programming (oop) basics.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Add tests to verify correctness.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
7. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
8. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics
print('Example 860')
