        Topic: File I/O: Beginner Guide
        Question: Describe File I/O (Beginner Guide) and provide a practical code example.

        Explanation:
        File I/O is an important Python topic. This advanced explanation explores internals, optimization, concurrency concerns, and interactions with other components or libraries. It is often encountered in tasks involving file i/o.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Add tests to verify correctness.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
4. Profile the code to find bottlenecks.
5. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
6. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
7. Document assumptions and usage examples.
8. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
9. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
10. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
11. Document assumptions and usage examples.

        Example:
        with open('data.txt') as f:
    text = f.read()
