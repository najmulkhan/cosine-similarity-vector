        Topic: Stacks and Queues: Performance Considerations
        Question: What are the key principles behind Stacks and Queues (Performance Considerations)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Stacks and Queues is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving stacks and queues.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
2. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
5. Refactor repetitive code into functions or classes.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Stacks and Queues
print('Example 1370')
