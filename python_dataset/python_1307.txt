        Topic: Image Processing with PIL: Common Mistakes
        Question: How does Image Processing with PIL (Common Mistakes) work in Python? Provide a detailed explanation.

        Explanation:
        Image Processing with PIL is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving image processing with pil.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
2. Handle common edge cases and input validation.
3. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
4. Add tests to verify correctness.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.

        Example:
