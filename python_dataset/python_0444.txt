        Topic: Iterators: Practical Example
        Question: How do you implement Iterators (Practical Example) in Python with a step-by-step example?

        Explanation:
        Iterators is an important Python topic. This section explains the concept in simple terms, with clear analogies and basic syntax examples to get started quickly. It is often encountered in tasks involving iterators.

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Document assumptions and usage examples.
2. Write a minimal example to demonstrate the concept.
3. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
4. Start by reviewing the basic syntax and definitions.
5. Add tests to verify correctness.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Iterators
print('Example 444')
