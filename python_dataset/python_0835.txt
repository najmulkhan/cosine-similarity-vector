        Topic: Internationalization (i18n): Real-world Use Case
        Question: What are the key principles behind Internationalization (i18n) (Real-world Use Case)? Give examples and common pitfalls.

        Explanation:
        Internationalization (i18n) is an important Python topic. This explanation covers the implementation details, trade-offs, and typical use-cases, along with code patterns commonly used in production. It is often encountered in tasks involving internationalization (i18n).

        Step-by-Step Solution:
        1. Explain the expected output and why it occurs.
2. Document assumptions and usage examples.
3. Document assumptions and usage examples.
4. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
5. Use library utilities when available instead of reinventing.
6. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.
7. Consider complexity and potential optimizations.

        Example:
        # Example snippet illustrating Internationalization (i18n)
print('Example 835')
